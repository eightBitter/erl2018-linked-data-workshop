The richest people per capita in the world were members of the Osage Indian nation in Oklahoma after oil was discovered beneath their land. Then, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. Her relatives were shot and poisoned. Many of those who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered. It became the FBI's first major homicide investigation... and the bureau badly bungled the case. J. Edgar Hoover turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White, who put together an undercover team which began to expose one of the most chilling conspiracies in American history.10aUnited States.bFederal Bureau of InvestigationvCase studies.24aUnited StatesbFederal Bureau of InvestigationvCase studies. 0aOsage IndiansxCrimes againstvCase studies. 0aMurderzOklahomazOsage CountyvCase studies. 0aHomicide investigationzOklahomazOsage CountyvCase studies. 0aOsage County (Okla.)xHistoryy20th century. 7aTrue crime stories.2lcgft08iOnline version:aGrann, David, author.tKillers of the Flower Moon.dNew York : Doubleday, [2016]z9780385534253w(DLC)  2016033222  aC0bNRC02423cam  2200481 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077020002900094020002600123035002300149040011300172042000800285043001200293049001400305050002700319070002700346082001700373100002800390245008000418264004800498264001000546300004300556336002600599337002800625338002700653504005100680505053800731520018601269650003901455650003601494650005901530650003001589650003601619650003201655650003601687651002701723655001901750776012401769994001201893019003601905ocn952964492OCoLC20170531104125.0160624t20172017nyua     b    001 0 eng    a  2016029615  a9781594206559qhardcover  a1594206554qhardcover  a(Sirsi) o952964492  aDNAL/DLCbengerdacAGLdDLCdOCLCFdOCLCOdBTCTAdBDXdYDXdOCLCQdVTLdDADdZHBdYDXdFM0dOCLCOdJSEdT3B  apcc  an-usu--  aNRCCxrsd00aTX715.2.S68bE328 20170 aTX715.2.S68bE344 201700a641.59752231 aEdge, John T.,eauthor.14aThe potlikker papers :ba food history of the modern South /cJohn T.

Bannon was a bomb-throwing pugilist who'd never run a campaign and was despised by Democrats and Republicans alike. Yet Bannon's hard-edged ethno-nationalism and his elaborate, years-long plot to destroy Hillary Clinton paved the way for Trump's unlikely victory. Trump became the avatar of a dark but powerful worldview that dominated the airwaves and spoke to voters whom others couldn't see. Trump's campaign was the final phase of a populist insurgency that had been building up in America for years, and Bannon, its inscrutable mastermind, believed it was the culmination of a hard-right global uprising that would change the world. From the reporter who was there at the very beginning comes the revealing inside story of the partnership between Steve Bannon and Donald Trump -- the key to understanding the rise of the alt-right, the fall of Hillary Clinton, and the hidden forces that drove the greatest upset in American political history. Based on dozens of interviews conducted over six years, Green spins the master narrative of the 2016 campaign from its origins in the far fringes of right-wing politics and reality television to its culmination inside Trump's penthouse on election night.10aBannon, Stephen K.xInfluence.10aBannon, Stephen K.xPolitical activity.10aTrump, Donald,d1946-xFriends and associates. 0aPresidentszUnited StatesxElectiony2016. 0aCampaign managementzUnited States. 0aRight-wing extremistszUnited States. 4aPOLITICAL SCIENCE / Political Process / Campaigns & Elections. 4aHISTORY / United States / 21st Century. 4aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Political. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmenty2009-2017. 1aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmenty2009-2017. 46264-00/Zsymc‚y20  aC0bNRC02846cam  2200517 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077020002900094020002600123020003000149020002700179035002300206040015300229042000800382043001200390049001300402050002200415082001700437245015200454264004600606264001000652300005600662336002600718336003300744337002800777338002700805504005100832505016300883520073401046610003401780610004401814650002801858650004301886650004301929650003101972650002502003650003602028700003102064700005302095710003402148776010902182994001202291019002502303ocn953599088OCoLC20170914094152.0160815t20172017caua     b    001 0 eng    a  2016017476  a9781452145402qhardcover  a1452145407qhardcover  z9781452158587qepub, mobi  z1452158584qepub, mobi  a(Sirsi) o953599088  aDLCbengerdacDLCdYDXCPdBTCTAdBDXdOCLCOdOCLCFdOCLCOdJSEdWIMdFM0dVP@dILCdYDXdABGdTXDRIdOSUdOCLCAdCHVBKdOCLCOdIGAdAL5CWdZLMdXII  apcc  an-us---  aNRCCxfb00aZ733.U6bC36 201700a025.3/1322304aThe card catalog :bbooks, cards, and literary treasures /cthe Library of Congress ; foreword by Carla Hayden ; [text written by Peter Devereaux]. 1aSan Francisco :bChronicle Books,c[2017] 4c√2017  a224 pages :billustrations (chiefly color) ;c24 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aOrigins of the card catalog -- The enlightened catalog -- Constructing a catalog -- The nation's library and catalog -- The rise and fall of the card catalog.  a"The Library of Congress brings booklovers an enriching tribute to the power of the written word and to the history of our most beloved books.

When Kristen Radtke was in college, the sudden death of a beloved uncle and, not long after his funeral, the sight of an abandoned mining town marked the beginning moments of a lifelong fascination with ruins and with people and places left behind. Over time, this fascination deepened until it triggered a journey around the world in search of ruined places. Now, in this genre-smashing graphic memoir, she leads us through deserted towns in the American Midwest, Italian villas, islands in the Philippines, New York City, and the delicate passageways of the human heart. At once narrative and factual, historical and personal, Radtke's stunning illustrations and piercing text never shy away from the big questions: why are we here, and what will we leave behind?"--cProvided by publisher.10aRadtke, KristenxPsychologyvComic books, strips, etc.10aRadtke, KristenxTravelvComic books, strips, etc.14aRadtke, KristenvComic books, strips, etc.xPsychology.14aRadtke, KristenvComic books, strips, etc.xTravel. 0aCartoonistszUnited StatesvBiography. 0aLoss (Psychology)vComic books, strips, etc. 4aCOMICS & GRAPHIC NOVELSxLiterary. 4aCOMICS & GRAPHIC NOVELSxContemporary Women. 4aLoss (Psychology)vComic books, strips, etc. 4aCartoonistszUnited StatesvComic books, strips, etc. 7aAutobiographies.2lcgft 7aAutobiographical comics.2lcgft 7aGraphic novels.2lcgft08iOnline version:aRadtke, Kristen.tImagine wanting only this.bFirst edition.dNew York : Pantheon, 2017z9781101870846w(DLC)  2016035188  aC0bNRC04408cam  2200697 i 450000100090000000300060000900500170001500800410003201000170007303500210009004000810011101900150019202000180020702000260022502000380025102000350028904200080032404300300033205000230036208200270038510000300041224501020044225000190054426400310056330000280059433600260062233700280064833800270067650400510070352015540075450501720230860000280248060000250250860000250253360000280255865000490258665000580263565000460269365000540273965000810279365000530287465000300292765100470295765100450300465000510304965000550310065000780315565000460323365000460327965000220332565100450334765100470339265000580343965000810349765500240357894900140360296000300361696100220364698400290366898700130369713308760OCoLC20170930055627.1170202s2017    nyu      b    001 0ceng    a  2017000952  a(Sirsi) 13308760  aDLCbengerdacDLCdYDXdBTCTAdBDXdOCLCOdJTHdDADdOCOdTXWBRdTXDRIdYDX  a1002304975  a9781101906187  a1101906189qhardcover  z9780525495758qaudiobook download  z9781101906194qelectronic book  apcc  an-us-caan-us---ances---00aE184.S15bM37 201700a305.868/72840794662231 aMarkham, Lauren,eauthor.14aThe far away brothers :btwo young migrants and the making of an American life /cLauren Markham.  aFirst edition. 1aNew York :bCrown,c[2017]  axvi, 298 pages ;c25 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.  a"The deeply reported story of identical twin brothers who escape El Salvador's violence to build new lives in California--fighting to survive, to stay, and to belong. Growing up in rural El Salvador in the wake of the civil war, Ernesto Flores had always had a fascination with the United States, the faraway land of skyscrapers and Nikes, while his identical twin, Raul, never felt that northbound tug. But when Ernesto ends up on the wrong side of the region's brutal gangs he is forced to flee the country, and Raul, because he looks just like his brother, follows close behind--away from one danger and toward the great American unknown. In this urgent chronicle of contemporary immigration, journalist Lauren Markham follows the seventeen-year-old Flores twins as they make their harrowing journey across the Rio Grande and the Texas desert, into the hands of immigration authorities, and from there to their estranged older brother's custody in Oakland, CA. Soon these unaccompanied minors are navigating a new school in a new language, working to pay down their mounting coyote debt, and facing their day in immigration court, while also encountering the triumphs and pitfalls of life as American teenagers--girls, grades, Facebook--with only each other for support. With intimate access and breathtaking range, Markham offers a coming of age tale that is also a nuanced portrait of Central America's child exodus, an investigation of U.S. immigration policy, and an unforgettable testament to the migrant experience."--Provided by publisher.0 aThe missing -- The flood -- The churn -- The walls -- The courthouse -- The detained -- The arrest -- The girls -- The failed -- The halt -- The long walk -- The land.10aFlores, Ernesto,d1997-10aFlores, Raul,d1997-14aFlores, Raul,d1997-14aFlores, Ernesto,d1997- 0aSalvadoranszCaliforniazOaklandvBiography. 0aSalvadoran AmericanszCaliforniazOaklandvBiography. 0aIllegal alienszUnited StatesvBiography. 0aRefugeeszCaliforniazOaklandxSocial conditions. 0aSalvadoran AmericanszCaliforniazSan Francisco Bay AreaxSocial conditions. 0aUnaccompanied immigrant childrenzUnited States. 0aTwin brothersvBiography. 0aUnited StatesxEmigration and immigration. 0aEl SalvadorxEmigration and immigration. 4aRefugeeszOakland (Calif.)xSocial conditions. 4aSalvadoran AmericanszOakland (Calif.)vBiography. 4aSalvadoran AmericanszSan Francisco Bay Area (Calif.)xSocial conditions. 4aSalvadoranszOakland (Calif.)vBiography. 4aIllegal alienszUnited StatesvBiography. 4aTwinsvBiography. 4aEl SalvadorxImmigration and emigration. 4aUnited StatesxImmigration and emigration. 1aSalvadoran AmericanszCaliforniazOaklandvBiography. 1aSalvadoran AmericanszCaliforniazSan Francisco Bay AreaxSocial conditions. 7aBiographies.2lcgft  hDDA-PRINT  o1s27.00uHSFIR-BBRXzUSD  fSBm301009nCloth  a20171013b113828cYBP-US  a1330876005897cam  2200721 i 450000100090000000300060000900500170001500800410003201000170007301900250009002000180011502000430013302000280017603500210020404001120022504200080033704300120034505000220035708200170037910000290039624500760042525000190050126400400052030000460056033600260060633700280063233800270066050400670068750506070075452025600136160000380392160000460395961000600400561000490406561000300411460000380414460000460418261000760422861000470430461000660435165000370441765000410445465100370449565000410453265000200457365000400459365000440463365000220467765000400469965000360473965100200477565100340479565500230482965500210485265500190487365500240489277601510491694900140506796000300508196100220511198400290513398700130516213270122OCoLC20170930055517.4161122s2017    nyua     b    001 0ceng    a  2016053946  a995268927a995381785  a9780307907271  a0307907279q(hard cover ;qalk. paper)  z9780307948373q(e-book)  a(Sirsi) 13270122  aNcU/DLCbengerdacNOCdDLCdYDXdBDXdBTCTAdOCLCFdGK8dBURdIK2dFM0dJAOdOBEdTXNPSdIGAdSADPLdOCLCQ  apcc  an-us-mi00aF574.B2bM36 201700a977.4/222231 aMarkel, Howard,eauthor.14aThe Kelloggs :bthe battling brothers of Battle Creek /cHoward Markel.  aFirst edition. 1aNew York :bPantheon Books,c[2017]  axxix, 506 pages :billustrations ;c25 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 393-480) and index.0 aIntroduction : The Cain and Abel of America's heartland -- Part I.

His youngest brother, Will, was the founder of the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company, which revolutionized the mass production of food and what we eat for breakfast. In The Kelloggs, Howard Markel tells the sweeping saga of these two extraordinary men, whose lifelong competition and enmity toward one another changed America's notion of health and wellness from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries, and who helped change the course of American medicine, nutrition, wellness, and diet. The Kelloggs were of Puritan stock, a family that came to the shores of New England in the mid-seventeenth century, went west to the wooded Michigan frontier to start a farm that became one of the biggest in the county, and then renounced it all for the religious calling of Ellen Harmon White, a self-proclaimed prophetess, and James White, whose new Seventh-day Adventist theology was based on Christian principles and sound body, mind, and hygiene rules--Ellen called it "health reform." The Whites groomed the young John Kellogg for a central role in the Seventh-day Adventist Church and sent him to America's finest medical school, Bellevue Hospital Medical College. Kellogg's main medical focus--and America's number one malady: indigestion. Markel gives us the life and times of the Kellogg brothers of Battle Creek: Dr. John Harvey Kellogg and his world-famous Battle Creek Sanitarium medical center, spa, and grand hotel attracted thousands actively pursuing health and well-being. Among the guests: Mary Todd Lincoln, Amelia Earhart, Booker T. Washington, Johnny Weissmuller, Dale Carnegie, Sojourner Truth, Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and George Bernard Shaw. And the presidents he advised: Taft, Harding, Hoover, and Roosevelt, with first lady Eleanor. The brothers Kellogg experimented on malt, wheat, and corn meal, and, tinkering with special ovens and toasting devices, came up with a ready-to-eat, easily digested cereal they called Corn Flakes. As Markel chronicles the Kelloggs' fascinating, Magnificent Ambersons-like ascent into the pantheon of American industrialists, we see the vast changes in American social mores that took shape in diet, health, medicine, philanthropy, and food manufacturing during seven decades--changing the lives of millions and helping to shape our industrial age."--Jacket.10aKellogg, John Harvey,d1852-1943.10aKellogg, W.

Stanton raised an army of a million men and directed it from his Washington telegraph office, with Lincoln often at his side. He arrested and imprisoned thousands for "war crimes, " some serious and some merely political. He was essential to the nation's survival, and Lincoln never wavered in his support for Stanton. As Lincoln lay dying, Stanton took over the government, informing the nation of the attacks on Lincoln and others, starting the investigation of the assassination, Under Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, Stanton insisted that the army had to remain in the South, to protect blacks and Unionists, while the president wanted to withdraw the troops. It was Johnson's ill-advised attempt to remove Stanton that led to the first impeachment of a president, an impeachment Johnson survived by a single vote. The New York diarist George Templeton Strong described Stanton after his death as 'honest, patriotic, able, indefatigable, warm-hearted, unselfish, incorruptible, arbitrary, capricious, tyrannical, vindictive, hateful, and cruel." But Stanton was also Lincoln's "right-hand man, " responsible with Lincoln and Grant for saving the Union. In this, the first full biography of Stanton in fifty years, Stahr restores this complicated American hero to his proper place in our national story."--Jacket.10aStanton, Edwin M.q(Edwin McMasters),d1814-1869.10aUnited States.bWar DepartmentvBiography.10aLincoln, Abraham,d1809-1865xFriends and associates.14aLincoln, Abraham,d1809-1865.14aStanton, Edwin M.q(Edwin McMasters),d1814-1869.17aUnited States.bWar Department.2fast0(OCoLC)fst0185325727aAmerican Civil War (1861-1865)2fast0(OCoLC)fst0135165827aReconstruction (United States : 1865-1877)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01754987 0aCabinet officerszUnited StatesvBiography. 0aStatesmenzUnited StatesvBiography. 0aUnited StatesxHistoryyCivil War, 1861-1865vBiography. 0aReconstruction (U.S. history, 1865-1877)vBiography. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmenty1861-1865. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmenty1865-1869. 4aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHYxPolitical. 4aHISTORYzUnited Statesx19th Century. 4aHISTORYzUnited StatesxCivil War Period (1850-1877) 4aCabinet officers.0(OCoLC)fst00843535 4aFriendship.0(OCoLC)fst00935174 4aPolitics and government.0(OCoLC)fst01919741 4aStatesmen.0(OCoLC)fst01131990 7aUnited States.2fast 7a1861-18772fast 7aBiographies.2fast 7aBiography.2fast 7aHistory.2fast 7aBiographies.2lcgft2 aFrank and Virginia Williams Collection of Lincolniana (Mississippi State University.

I embraced American freedoms, raised my children to cherish and revere them, and lost a son who swore an oath to defend them, because I come from a place where they do not exist.' In fewer than three hundred words, Muslim American Gold Star father Khizr Khan electrified viewers around the world when he took the stage at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. And when he offered to lend Donald Trump his own much-read and dog-eared pocket Constitution, his gesture perfectly encapsulated the feelings of millions. But who was that man, standing beside his wife, extolling the promises and virtues of the U.S. Constitution? In this urgent and timeless immigrant story, we learn that Khizr Khan has been many things. He was the oldest of ten children born to farmers in Pakistan, and a curious and thoughtful boy who listened rapt as his grandfather recited Rumi beneath the moonlight. He was a university student who read the Declaration of Independence and was awestruck by what might be possible in life. He was a hopeful suitor, awkwardly but earnestly trying to win the heart of a woman far out of his league. He was a brilliant and diligent young family man who worked two jobs to save enough money to put himself through Harvard Law School. He was a loving father who, having instilled in his children the ideals that brought him and his wife to America--the sense of shared dignity and mutual responsibility--tragically lost his son, an Army captain killed while protecting his base camp in Iraq. He was and is a patriot, and a fierce advocate for the rights, dignities, and values enshrined in the American system. An American Family shows us who Khizr Khan and millions of other American immigrants are, and why--especially in these tumultuous times--we must not be afraid to step forward for what we believe in when it matters most."--Dust jacket flap.0 aShoeless in a shaft of sunlight -- Twenty-one sparrows -- A stick becomes a ney -- Tomorrow will be better -- The wonders of the DMV -- Already American -- No man is complete until his education is complete -- Shining city -- Baba -- Always be a river -- God is found among the people.  aKhan electrified viewers around the world when he took the stage at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.

Here Khan tells readers why we must not be afraid to step forward for what we believe in when it matters most.10aKhan, Khizr,d1950- 0aPakistani AmericansvBiography. 7aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Personal Memoirs. 7aFAMILY & RELATIONSHIPS / Military Families. 7aSOCIAL SCIENCE / Emigration & Immigration. 7aAutobiographies.2lcgft 7aBiographies.2lcgft  hDDA-PRINT  o1s27.00uHSFIR-BBRXzUSD  fSBm301009nCloth  a20171121b114655cYBP-US  a1351147606660cam  2200637 i 450000100090000000300060000900500170001500800410003201000170007303500210009004000990011101900480021002000180025802000260027604200080030204300120031005000210032208200220034310000290036524500640039426400820045830000740054033600260061433700280064033800270066850400670069550509140076252010990167652021390277560000590491460000590497365000420503265100550507465100550512965000610518465000440524565000420528965000610533165000440539265000420543665000490547865000360552765100250556365100550558865100550564364800200569865500230571865500210574165500240576277601280578694900140591496000300592896100220595898400290598098700130600913533892OCoLC20171116144758.7170707s2017    nyuaf    b    001 0beng    a  2017032686  a(Sirsi) 13533892  aDLCbengerdacDLCdYDXdBDXdOCLCOdGK8dOCLCFdVTLdJAIdIGAdFM0dBURdCZAdOVYdTXKYLdYDX  a974958282a975039136a975079613a1003731378  a9780525427902  a0525427902qhardcover  apcc  an-us---00aE807b.D335 201700a973.917092aB2231 aDallek, Robert,eauthor.10aFranklin D.

Robert Dallek's Franklin D. Roosevelt: A Political Life takes a fresh look at the many compelling questions of his remarkable presidency: How did a man who came from so privileged a background become one of the greatest champions of the country's needy? How did someone who never won recognition for his intellect foster such revolutionary innovations in our economic and social institutions? How did Roosevelt bring about such a profound change in America's foreign relations, leading it from isolationism to become an international superpower? By the time he became president, Roosevelt already commanded the respect and affection of millions of people through his services as assistant secretary of the Navy and governor of New York. Although many of his biographers agree that the onset of polio at the age of thirty-nine endowed him with a much greater sense of humanity, Dallek views that affliction as an insufficient explanation for his transformation into a masterful politician who would win an unprecedented four presidential terms and advance a remarkably progressive agenda. He attributes Roosevelt's success to two perceptive political insights. First, he made the presidency the central, most influential institution in the political system. Under his watch the country was able to recover from the Depression and entered World War II, but more controversially, he used that power in an unsuccessful attempt to pack the Supreme Court. Second, he understood that effectiveness in the American political system depended on building consensus and commanding stable, long-term popular support. In addressing the country's international and domestic challenges, Roosevelt recognized the critical importance of remaining attentive to the full range of public sentiment regarding policy decisions--perhaps his most important lesson in effective leadership, and one that remains vital today."--Dust jacket flaps.10aRoosevelt, Franklin D.q(Franklin Delano),d1882-1945.17aRoosevelt, Franklin D.q(Franklin Delano),d1882-1945. 0aPresidentszUnited StatesvBiography. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmenty1933-1945. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmenty1919-1933. 4aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Presidents & Heads of State. 4aHISTORY / United States / 20th Century. 4aPOLITICAL SCIENCE / History & Theory. 7aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Presidents & Heads of State. 7aHISTORY / United States / 20th Century. 7aPOLITICAL SCIENCE / History & Theory. 7aPolitics and government.0(OCoLC)fst01919741 7aPresidents.0(OCoLC)fst01075723 7aUnited States.2fast 1aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmenty1933-1945. 1aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmenty1919-1933. 7a1919-19452fast 7aBiographies.2fast 7aBiography.2fast 7aBiographies.2lcgft08iOnline version:aDallek, Robert, author.tFranklin D.

They make a venom so toxic it can kill a human in three minutes. Their sting--microscopic spears that pierce with five million times the acceleration of gravity--is the fastest known motion in the animal kingdom. Made of roughly 95 percent water, some jellies are barely perceptible virtuosos of disguise, while others glow with a luminescence that has revolutionized biotechnology. Yet until recently, jellyfish were largely ignored by science, and they remain among the most poorly understood of ocean dwellers. More than a decade ago, Juli Berwald left a career in ocean science to raise a family in landlocked Austin, Texas. But then jellyfish drew her back to the sea. Recent, massive blooms of billions of jellyfish have clogged power plants, decimated fisheries, and caused millions of dollars of damage. Driven by questions about how overfishing, coastal development, and climate change were contributing to a jellyfish population explosion, Juli embarked on a scientific odyssey. She traveled the globe to meet the biologists who devote their careers to jellies, hitched rides on Japanese fishing boats to see giant jellyfish in the wild, raised jellyfish in her dining room, and throughout it all marveled at the complexity of these alluring and ominous biological wonders. Gracefully blending personal memoir with crystal-clear distillations of science, Spineless is the story of how Juli learned to navigate and ultimately embrace her ambition, her curiosity, and her passion for the natural world. She discovers that jellyfish science is more than just a quest for answers. It's a call to realize our collective responsibility for the planet we share."--Dust jacket flaps. 0aJellyfishes. 4aJellyfishes.0(OCoLC)fst00982280 4aNATURE / Animals / Marine Life. 4aNATURE / Ecosystems & Habitats / Oceans & Seas. 4aSCIENCE / Life Sciences / Marine Biology.08iOnline version:aBerwald, Juli, author.tSpinelessdNew York : Riverhead Books, 2017z9780735211278w(DLC) 2017007895  aQL377 .S4 B47 2017hNRL-STACKSiS03360040GkONORDERzYBPCAT  a171227b27.00e22.14f376348g1  a99974500274  a981205811a981621372a981802139a981989795  aNSFIR-NMAReYANKEE04183cam  2200505 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077020002900094020002600123020003500149035002300184040010300207042000800310043001200318049001400330050002400344082001900368100002800387245009500415250001900510264004700529264001000576300004400586336002600630337002800656338002700684504005100711505068200762520033301444520148401777600001903261650005103280650003303331650003703364650005403401650003203455650003203487650004003519650005103559655002803610994001203638019002703650ocn976406119OCoLC20171208094729.0170315t20172017nyua     b    001 0aeng    a  2017010792  a9781627794091qhardcover  a1627794093qhardcover  z9781627794107qelectronic book  a(Sirsi) o976406119  aDLCbengerdacDLCdOCLCOdOCLCQdSFRdIK2dZPPdDADdOCLCOdFM0dIGAdPFLCLdIUKdTXKYLdYDXdBUR  apcc  an-us---  aNRCCxrsd00aQA76.2.L36bA3 201700a004.092aB2231 aLanier, Jaron,eauthor.10aDawn of the new everything :bencounters with reality and virtual reality /cJaron Lanier.  aFirst edition. 1aNew York :bHenry Holt and Company,c2017. 4c√2017  axv, 351 pages :billustrations ;c25 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aPreface: Virtual reality's moment -- Introduction -- 1960s: terrors of Eden -- Rescue spacecraft -- Batch process -- Why I love VR (about the basics) -- Bug in the system (about the dark side of VR) -- Road -- Coast -- Valley of unearthly delights -- Alien encounters -- The feeling of immersion -- To don the new everything (about haptics with a little about avatars) -- Nautical dawn -- Six degrees (a little about sensors and VR data) -- Found -- Be your own paramidion (about visual displays for VR) -- The VPL experience -- Inside-out spheres (a little about VR "video" and sound) -- Scene -- How we settled into a seed for the future -- 1992, out -- Coda: Reality's foil.  aThe Microsoft interdisciplinary scientist largely credited with popularizing virtual reality reflects on his lifelong relationship with technology, showing VR's ability to illuminate and amplify our understanding of our species and how the brain and body connect to the world.

An inventive blend of autobiography, science writing, philosophy, and advice, Dawn of the New Everything tells the wild story of Lanier's personal and professional life as a scientist. Raised in the UFO territory of New Mexico, Jaron lived with his father in a geodesic dome they built together in the desert after the sudden death of his mother. Attending college at age fourteen, Lanier was immediately hooked on computers, and from then on his life became entwined with technology. He forged an unconventional career path that eventually led him to the early frontier days of Silicon \/alley, where he founded the first VR start-up. An intense and imaginative dreamer, he retained a fierce humanism that continues to guide his innovative work and thought. Understanding virtual reality as being both a scientific and cultural adventure, Lanier demonstrates it to be, in fact, one of the most humanistic settings for technology. In this illuminating book, he cautions against certain computational beliefs such as AI, even as he explains the dazzling possibilities of \/R and argues that it can make our lives richer and fuller."--Dust jacket flap.10aLanier, Jaron. 0aComputer scientistszUnited StatesvBiography. 0aVirtual realityxPhilosophy. 0aVirtual realityxSocial aspects. 4aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Science & Technology. 4aCOMPUTERS / Social Aspects. 4aCOMPUTERS / Virtual Worlds. 4aTECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING / History. 4aComputer scientistszUnited StatesvBiography. 7aAutobiographies.2lcgft  aC0bNRC  a1003790045a101081941503658cam  2200553Ii 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036020003100077020002800108035002400136040007400160043002100234050002800255082001700283100004300300245011800343250001900461264007400480264001000554300005100564336002600615336003300641337002800674338002700702504006200729505037700791520130401168650002002472650004202492650005602534650004602590650004002636650004402676650003002720651001702750651001702767651002802784655002202812655002102834655001502855700003802870700003002908710002402938949006702962980003603029983001603065985002303081on1005367737OCoLC20171128105541.7171005t20172017nyua     b    001 0 eng d  a9780062435552q(hardcover)  a0062435558q(hardcover)  a(Sirsi) o1005367737  aVPWbengerdacVPWdOCLCQdGKXdNYPdIGAdCLEdTCHdOCLCFdPFLCLdCDX  an-us-dcaa-ii--- 4aTX724.5.I4bB26156 201704a641.59542231 aBajaj, Ashokc(Restaurateur),eauthor.10aRasika :bflavors of India /cstories by Ashok Bajaj ; recipes by Vikram Sunderam ; coauthored by David Hagedorn.  aFirst edition. 1aNew York, NY :bEcco, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers,c[2017] 4c√2017  axxv, 310 pages :bcolor illustrations ;c26 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references (page 299) and index.0 aIntroduction: the history of Rasika and the rise of four-star Indian cooking -- The foundatioin of Rasika's cooking -- Basic flavorings and sauces -- Cocktails and mocktails -- Appetizers -- Vegetables -- Tandoori-style grilling -- Fish and seafood entr‚ees -- Poultry, game, and meat entr‚ees -- Rice, grains, and legumes -- Breads -- Chutneys and condiments -- Desserts.  aA vibrant and sumptuous cookbook of innovative recipes and reinvented classics of modern Indian cuisine.

Now, he takes us inside a sphere utterly inimical to human life. He describes navigating the extreme challenge of long-term spaceflight, both existential and banal: the devastating effects on the body; the isolation from everyone he loves and the comforts of Earth; the pressures of constant close cohabitation; the catastrophic risks of depressurization or colliding with space junk, and the still more haunting threat of being unable to help should tragedy strike at home -- an agonizing situation Kelly faced when, on another mission, his twin brother's wife, Gabrielle Giffords, was shot while he still had two months in space. Kelly's humanity, compassion, humor, and passion resonate throughout, as he recalls his rough-and-tumble New Jersey childhood and the youthful inspiration that sparked his astounding career, and as he makes clear his belief that Mars will be the next, ultimately challenging step in American spaceflight. Here we see the triumph of the human imagination, the strength of the human will, and the boundless wonder of the galaxy.10aKelly, Scott,d1964-14aKelly, Scott,d1964-20aInternational Space Station. 0aAstronautszUnited StatesvBiography. 0aSpace flightsvBiography. 4aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHYxPersonal Memoirs. 4aSCIENCExAstronomy. 4aSCIENCExSpace Science. 4aAstronautszUnited StatesvBiography. 4aAstronauts.0(OCoLC)fst00819615 1aAstronautszUnited StatesvBiography. 7aUnited States.2fast 7aAutobiographies.2lcgft 7aAutobiographies.2fast 7aBiography.2fast1 aDean, Margaret Lazarus,d1972-eauthor.  aTL789.85 .K45 A3 2017hHIL-READiS03359901UkONORDER0YBPCAT  a171219b29.95e24.56f368770g1  a99974448199  a946693431a1003847342a1005507446a1005675674  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE02639cam  2200397Ii 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036020002900077020001500106035002400121040006400145050001500209082001400224100003600238245007300274250001900347264007500366264001000441300005600451336002100507336002800528337002500556338002300581504005700604520125000661600004901911600006101960600005102021650002402072949005602096980003602152983001602188019001402204985002302218on1011232178OCoLC20171204130833.9170607t20172017enka     b    000 0 eng d  a9781909526464qhardcover  a1909526460  a(Sirsi) o1011232178  aEUMbengerdacEUMdOCLCOdVMIdUABdBTCTAdYDXdBDXdERASA14aPR5397.F7304a823.72231 aFrayling, Christopher,eauthor.10aFrankenstein :bthe first two hundred years /cChristopher Frayling.  aFirst edition. 1aLondon, UK :bReel Art Press, an imprint of Rare Art Press Ltd,c2017. 4c√2017  a208 pages :billustrations (chiefly color) ;c28 cm  atext2rdacontent  astill image2rdacontent  aunmediated2rdamedia  avolume2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 206-207).  aOn New Year's Day 1818, Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein was first published in an anonymous three-volume edition of 500 copies. Some thought the book was too radical in implication. A few found the central theme intriguing ... no-one predicted its success. This book, celebrating the two hundredth birthday of Frankenstein, traces, in colourful and engaging ways, the journey of Shelley's Frankenstein from limited edition literature to the bloodstream of contemporary culture. It includes new research on the novel's origins, and a facsimile reprint of the earliest-known manuscript version of the creation scene. Frankenstein's legacy is to be seen all over the world--on small and large screens, in print and online, on stage and on hoardings, in graphic novels, comics and even on cereal packets. From a Regency nightmare, Frankenstein's creature has even become a cuddly childhood companion--thoroughly munstered, so to speak. The real creation myth of modern times--the era of genetic engineering, three-parent babies, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, robotics and singularity, human/animal interfaces and secularism--is no longer Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. The real creation myth is Frankenstein. -- Inside jacket flap.10aFrankenstein, Victorc(Fictitious character)10aShelley, Mary Wollstonecraft,d1797-1851.tFrankenstein.00aFrankenstein's Monsterc(Fictitious character) 0aFrankenstein films.  aPR5397 .F73 hHIL-READiS03359902VkONORDER0YBPCAT  a171219b39.95e32.76f368770g1  a40027713996  a975487994  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE02371cam  2200493Ii 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036020003100077020002800108020003300136020001500169020001800184035002400202037009400226040019400320050002900514082001500543100003000558245005600588250001900644264005100663264001000714300002300724336002600747337002800773338002700801520042000828650002601248650002301274650002701297650003601324650002401360655002901384655002901413655003101442655002201473655002501495949006801520980003601588983001601624019021401640985002301854on1007537254OCoLC20171123150008.2171025t20172017nyu           000 f eng d  a9780316435314q(hardcover)  a0316435317q(hardcover)  z9780316439909q(large print)  a0316439908  a9780316439909  a(Sirsi) o1007537254  bLittle Brown & Co, 53 State st 9th Fl, Boston, MA, USA, 02109, (617)2270730nSAN 200-2205  aTXNbengerdacTXNdVHPdOCLCQdOI6dJAGdTXMALdJAIdUAPdVP@dIUKdMWDdYDXdBTCTAdBDXdIOUdKYCdFMGdRB0dWIMdTCHdJAOdTXKYLdUABdWLUdTXPdT3BdWIMVLdBUDAPdTXNPSdD9MdKVIJLdORX14aPS3623.E432443bH43 201704a813/.62231 aWeiner, Matthew,eauthor.10aHeather, the totality :ba novel /cMatthew Weiner.  aFirst edition. 1aNew York :bLittle, Brown and Company,c[2017] 4c√2017  a138 pages ;c22 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aMark and Karen Breakstone have constructed the idyllic life of wealth and status they always wanted, made complete by their beautiful and extraordinary daughter Heather.

Migration. Betrayal. Family secrets. Doomed love. Uncertain futures. In Daniel Alarcon's hands, these are transformed into deeply human stories with high stakes. In "The Thousands, " people are on the move and forging new paths; hope and heartbreak abound. A man deals with the fallout of his blind relatives' mysterious deaths and his father's mental breakdown and incarceration in "The Bridge." A gang member discovers a way to forgiveness and redemption through the haze of violence and trauma in "The Ballad of Rocky Rontal." And in the tour de force novella, "The Auroras", a man severs himself from his old life and seeks to make a new one in a new city, only to find himself seduced and controlled by a powerful woman. Richly drawn, full of unforgettable characters, The King is Always Above the People reveals experiences both unsettling and unknown, and yet eerily familiar in this new world"--cProvided by publisher. 0aEmigration and immigrationvFiction. 0aFamiliesvFiction. 0aGangsvFiction. 4aFICTION / Short Stories (single author). 4aFICTION / Literary. 4aFICTION / Hispanic & Latino. 7aShort stories.2lcgft08iOnline version:aAlarc‚on, Daniel, 1977- author.tKing is always above the peopledNew York : Riverhead Books, 2017z9781101623077w(DLC) 2017021321  aPS3601 .L333 A6 2017hHIL-READiS03359907-kONORDER0YBPCAT  a171219b27.00e22.14f368770g1  a99974448196  a978890230  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE03484cam  2200637 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077020004600094020004300140035002300183040010600206042000800312043001200320050002500332082001700357084004500374100002900419245003400448246002700482250002800509264004100537264001000578300002300588336002600611337002800637338002700665500002100692520129100713650002602004650003102030650004102061650002902102650005002131650002402181650002602205650002402231650003502255650005202290650004002342650006002382650003702442650004102479651001702520655003102537655003402568655002502602655001902627655003302646655002802679949006402707980003602771983001602807985002302823ocn986816495OCoLC20171128145242.9170621t20172017nyu           000 1 eng    a  2017027401  a9780451493422qhardcoverqacid-free paper  a0451493427qhardcoverqacid-free paper  a(Sirsi) o986816495  aDLCbengerdacDLCdYDXdBDXdOCLCOdOCLCFdVTLdCZAdBURdUAPdVP@dIUKdAZTdWIMVLdYDXdOCLCOdRB0  apcc  ae-it---00aPR6052.A57bM78 201700a823/.914223  aFIC019000aFIC014000aFIC0040002bisacsh1 aBanville, John,eauthor.10aMrs. Osmond /cJohn Banville.34aMrs. Osmond :ba novel  aFirst American edition. 1aNew York :bAlfred A.

Isabel Archer is a young American woman, swept off to Europe in the late nineteenth century by an aunt who hopes to round out the impetuous but naive girl's experience of the world. When Isabel comes into a large, unexpected inheritance, she is finagled into a marriage with the charming, penniless, and--as Isabel finds out too late--cruel and deceitful Gilbert Osmond, whose connection to a certain Madame Merle is suspiciously intimate. On a trip to England to visit her cousin Ralph Touchett on his deathbed, Isabel is offered a chance to free herself from the marriage, but nonetheless chooses to return to Italy. Banville follows James's story line to this point, but Mrs. Osmond is thoroughly Banville's own: the narrative inventiveness; the lyrical precision and surprise of his language; the layers of emotional and psychological intensity; the subtle, dark humor. And when Isabel arrives in Italy--along with someone else!--the novel takes off in directions that James himself would be thrilled to follow"--cProvided by publisher. 0aYoung womenvFiction. 0aAmericanszItalyvFiction. 0aInheritance and successionvFiction. 0aMarried peoplevFiction. 0aTriangles (Interpersonal relations)vFiction. 4aFICTION / Literary. 4aFICTION / Historical. 4aFICTION / Classics. 4aAmericans.0(OCoLC)fst00807488 4aInheritance and succession.0(OCoLC)fst00973371 4aMarried people.0(OCoLC)fst01010656 4aTriangles (Interpersonal relations)0(OCoLC)fst01156439 4aYoung women.0(OCoLC)fst01183301 1aInheritance and successionvFiction. 7aItaly.2fast 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aPsychological fiction.2lcgft 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aFiction.2fast 7aPsychological fiction.2fast 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft  aPR6052 .A57 M78 2017hHIL-READiS033598971kONORDER0YBPCAT  a171219b27.95e22.92f368770g1  a99974448200  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE02679cam  2200541 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077020003100094020002800125035002300153040013400176042000800310043001200318050002600330082001600356100003300372245005100405250001900456264003900475264001000514300004000524336002600564337002800590338002700618520044200645520042601087630003601513650003901549650003101588650003301619650003901652650003701691650003301728650002101761651003301782655002801815655004201843655003101885655001901916730003601935949006501971980003602036983001602072019002602088985002302114ocn981972663OCoLC20171204160535.4170919t20172017nyua          000 1 eng    a  2017041079  a9781250163301q(hardcover)  a1250163307q(hardcover)  a(Sirsi) o981972663  aDLCbengerdacDLCdYDXdBDXdWIMdHQDdORXdOCLCFdJQRdVTLdBURdUAPdIUKdTXKYLdGIBMLdVP@dYDXdOCLdNDSdWLMdT3BdP@NdILC  apcc  an-us-wa00aPS3556.R599bT95 201700a813/.542231 aFrost, Mark,d1953-eauthor.10aTwin Peaks :bthe final dossier /cMark Frost.  aFirst edition. 1aNew York :bFlatiron Books,c2017. 4c√2017  a137 pages :billustrations ;c24 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aWhile 'The Secret History of Twin Peaks' served to expand the mysteries of the town and place the unexplained phenomena that unfolded there into a vastly layered, wide-ranging history, Twin Peaks: The Final Dossier tells us what happened to key characters in the twenty-five years in between the events of the first series and the second.

Before the trial could take place, however, he was pronounced insane. Escaping a possible death sentence, he was sent to St. Elizabeths Hospital near Washington, D.C., where he was held for more than a decade. At the hospital, Pound was at his most infamous, and most contradictory. He was a genius and a traitor, a great poet and a madman. He was also an irresistible figure and, in his cell on Chestnut Ward and on the elegant hospital grounds, he was visited by the major poets and writers of his time. T. S. Eliot, Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Lowell, John Berryman, Charles Olson, and Frederick Seidel all went to sit with him. They listened to him speak and wrote of what they had seen. This was perhaps the world's most unorthodox literary salon: convened by a fascist, held in a lunatic asylum, with chocolate brownies and mayonnaise sandwiches served for tea. Pound continues to divide all who read and think of him. At the hospital, the doctors who studied him and the poets who learned from him each had a different understanding of this wild and most difficult man. Tracing Pound through the eyes of his visitors, Daniel Swift's The Bughouse tells a story of politics, madness, and modern art in the twentieth century." -- Publisher's description.10aPound, Ezra,d1885-1972xMental health.10aPound, Ezra,d1885-1972xFriends and associates.14aPound, Ezra,d1885-1972.20aSaint Elizabeths Hospital (Washington, D.C.)vBiography.27aSaint Elizabeths Hospital (Washington, D.C.)2fast0(OCoLC)fst00547007 7a1900-19992fast 0aPoets, Americany20th centuryvBiography. 0aPsychiatric hospital patientszUnited StatesvBiography. 4aFriendship.0(OCoLC)fst00935174 4aMental health.0(OCoLC)fst01016339 4aPoets, American.0(OCoLC)fst01067794 4aPsychiatric hospital patients.0(OCoLC)fst01081030 4aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Literary. 4aHISTORY / Modern / 20th Century. 7aUnited States.2fast 7aBiographies.2lcgft 7aBiographies.2fast 7aBiography.2fast  aPS3531 .O82 Z853 2017hHIL-READiS033599972kONORDER0YBPCAT  a171227b27.00e22.14f376332g1  a40027740253  a968639494a1003767068a1009717129a1009719117  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE03446cam  2200517 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077020003000094020002700124035002300151040009700174042000800271050002100279082001700300084004500317100002500362245013400387250001900521264004300540300005800583336002600641337002800667338002700695500002000722505027800742520127201020650001902292650001102311650004802322650004402370650004302414650003102457650003902488655002202527655002102549700003702570700003302607776014002640949005902780980003602839983001602875019001402891985002302905ocn952153365OCoLC20171021044350.8161020s2017    caua     b    001 0 eng    a  2016047716  a9780399578397q(hardback)  a0399578390q(hardback)  a(Sirsi) o952153365  aDLCbengerdacDLCdYDXCPdBTCTAdBDXdOCLCFdON8dRB0dTXDRIdLIQdOCLCOdSFRdOCLCQdFOLLT  apcc00aTX791b.C87 201700a641.85/3223  aCKB095000aCKB018000aCKB0240002bisacsh1 aCurl, Jami,eauthor.10aCandy is magic :breal ingredients, modern recipes /cJami Curl ; photography by Maggis Kirkland ; illustrations by Michelle Ott.  aFirst edition. 1aCalifornia :bTen Speed Press,c[2017]  avii, 303 pages :billustrations (some color) ;c27 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aIntroduction: A Real Life in Real Candy -- Chapter One: Ingredients, Tools, and Flavor -- Chapter Two: Crafting Core Ingredients -- Chapter Three: Lollipops -- Chapter Four: Caramels -- Chapter Five: Dreams Come Chew -- Chapter Six: Marshmallows -- Chapter Seven: Gumdrops.  aThis game-changing candy cookbook from the owner of Quin, a popular Portland-based candy company, offers more than 200 achievable recipes using real, natural ingredients for everything from flavor-packed fruit lollipops to light-as-air marshmallows. Chai Tea Lollipops, Honey and Sea Salt Marshmallows, Chocolate Pretzel Caramels, Cherry Cola Gumdrops -- this is not your average candy, or your average candy book. Candy-maker extraordinaire Jami Curl breaks down candy making into its most precise and foolproof steps. No guess work, no expensive equipment, just the best possible ingredients and stop-you-in-your-tracks-brilliant flavor combinations. She begins with the foundations of candy; how to create delicious syrups, purees, and "magic dusts" that are the building blocks for making lollipops, caramels, marshmallows, and gummy candy. But even more ingeniously, these syrups, purees, and magic dusts can be used to make a myriad of other sweet confections such as Strawberry Cream Soda, Peanut Butter Hot Fudge, Marshmallow Brownies, and Popcorn Ice Cream. And what to do with all your homemade candy? Jami has your covered, with instructions for making candy garlands, tiny candy-filled pinatas, candy ornaments, and more -- you are officially party ready. 0aConfectionery. 0aCandy. 4aCOOKING / Courses & Dishes / Confectionery. 4aCOOKING / Courses & Dishes / Chocolate. 4aCOOKING / Courses & Dishes / Desserts. 4aCandy.0(OCoLC)fst00845678 4aConfectionery.0(OCoLC)fst00874623 7aCookbooks.2lcgft 7aCookbooks.2fast1 aKirkland, Maggie,ephotographer.1 aOtt, Michelle,eillustrator.08iOnline version:aCurl, Jami, author.tCandy is magicbFirst edition.dBerkeley : Ten Speed Press, 2017z9780399578403w(DLC) 2016048680  aTX791 .C87 2017hHIL-READiS033599961kONORDER0YBPCAT  a171227b35.00e28.70f376332g1  a99974668601  a967521977  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE03593cam  2200589 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077020002900094020002600123020002400149035002300173040009800196042000800294043001200302050002700314082001500341084004500356100002900401245006600430264009200496300002300588336002600611337002800637338002700665520142300692650004002115650003302155650002902188650002402217650002402241650002502265650004002290650005102330650003502381650003402416650002902450651002202479651001902501655003002520655002902550655001902579655001902598655002902617776013602646949006602782980003602848983001602884019008002900985002302980ocn979562112OCoLC20171214144456.3170327s2017    nyu           000 1 eng    a  2017009744  a9780735219861qhardcover  a0735219869qhardcover  z9780735219878qEPub  a(Sirsi) o979562112  aDLCbengerdacDLCdBTCTAdBDXdOCLCFdYDXdBLPdUAPdCZAdOCLCOdIUKdKVIJLdYDXdOCLCOdOBE  apcc  an-us-vt00aPS3613.C5588bR33 201700a813/.6223  aFIC016000aFIC019000aFIC0370002bisacsh1 aMcKibben, Bill,eauthor.10aRadio free Vermont :ba fable of resistance /cBill McKibben. 1aNew York, New York :bBlue Rider Press, an imprint of Penguin Random House LLC,c[2017]  a224 pages ;c22 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  a"A book that's also the beginning of a movement, Bill McKibben's debut novel Radio Free Vermont follows a band of Vermont patriots who decide that their state might be better off as its own republic. As the host of Radio Free Vermont--"underground, underpowered, and underfoot"--seventy-two-year-old Vern Barclay is currently broadcasting from an "undisclosed and double-secret location." With the help of a young computer prodigy named Perry Alterson, Vern uses his radio show to advocate for a simple yet radical idea: an independent Vermont, one where the state secedes from the United States and operates under a free local economy. But for now, he and his radio show must remain untraceable, because in addition to being a lifelong Vermonter and concerned citizen, Vern Barclay is also a fugitive from the law. In Radio Free Vermont, Bill McKibben entertains and expands upon an idea that's become more popular than ever--seceding from the United States. Along with Vern and Perry, McKibben imagines an eccentric group of activists who carry out their own version of guerrilla warfare, which includes dismissing local middle school children early in honor of "Ethan Allen Day" and hijacking a Coors Light truck and replacing the stock with local brew. Witty, biting, and terrifyingly timely, Radio Free Vermont is Bill McKibben's fictional response to the burgeoning resistance movement"--cProvided by publisher. 0aGovernment, Resistance tovFiction. 0aSecessionzVermontvFiction. 0aCounterculturevFiction. 4aFICTION / Humorous. 4aFICTION / Literary. 4aFICTION / Political. 4aCounterculture.0(OCoLC)fst00881315 4aGovernment, Resistance to.0(OCoLC)fst00945663 4aSecession.0(OCoLC)fst01110536 4aFICTION / Humorous / General. 1aCounterculturevFiction. 0aVermontvFiction. 7aVermont.2fast 7aPolitical fiction.2lcgft 7aHumorous fiction.2gsafd 7aSatire.2gsafd 7aFiction.2fast 7aPolitical fiction.2fast08iOnline version:aMcKibben, Bill, author.tRadio free VermontdNew York : Blue Rider Press, [2017]z9780735219878w(DLC)  2017014871  aPS3613 .C5588 R33 2017hHIL-READiS033599983kONORDER0YBPCAT  a171227b22.00e18.04f376332g1  a99974448201  a978697031a978901873a979912756a980162431a980413514a980643696a981042613  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE02957cam  2200517 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077020002900094020002600123020003400149020003100183035002300214040009200237042000800329043001200337050002400349082002200373100003200395245011800427250001900545264004300564264001000607300008800617336002600705337002800731338002700759505069800786520044201484600002301926600002201949650004101971650004702012650005302059650004002112650003702152655002802189655002402217700003102241700002902272949006302301980003602364983001602400985002302416ocn962552927OCoLC20171007052901.4170522t20172017nyuaf         000 0aeng    a  2017024878  a9781250120571qhardcover  a1250120578qhardcover  z9781250151780qsigned edition  z1250151783qsigned edition  a(Sirsi) o962552927  aDLCbengerdacDLCdBTCTAdYDXdBDXdOCLCOdJQRdDADdOQXdCLEdFM0dJZ4dIGAdYDXdCZA  apcc  an-us---10aGV1196.F53bA3 201700a796.812092aB2231 aFlair, Ric,d1949-eauthor.10aSecond nature :bthe legacy of Ric Flair and the rise of Charlotte /cRic Flair and Charlotte with Brian Shields.  aFirst edition. 1aNew York :bSt. Martin's Press,c2017. 4c√2017  axvi, 368 pages, 8 unnumbered pages of plates :billustrations (some color) ;c25 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier0 aPart I.

In April 1917, Woodrow Wilson--champion of American democracy but also of segregation, advocate for free trade and a new world order based on freedom and justice--thrust the United States into the First World War in order to make the 'world safe for democracy'--only to see his dreams for a liberal international system dissolve into chaos, bloodshed, and betrayal. That October Vladimir Lenin--communist revolutionary and advocate for class war and 'dictatorship of the proletariat'--would overthrow Russia's earlier democratic revolution that had toppled the powerful czar, all in the name of liberating humanity--and instead would set up the most repressive totalitarian regime in history, the Soviet Union. In this incisive, fast-paced history, ... bestselling author Arthur Herman brilliantly reveals how Lenin and Wilson rewrote the rules of modern geopolitics. Prior to and through the end of World War I, countries marched into war only to advance or protect their national interests. After World War I, countries began going to war over ideas. Together Lenin and Wilson unleashed the disruptive ideologies that would sweep the world, from nationalism and globalism to Communism and terrorism, and that continue to shape our world today. Our new world disorder is the legacy left by Wilson and Lenin, and their visions of the perfectibility of man. One hundred years later, we still sit on the powder keg they first set the detonator to, through war and revolution."--Dust jacket flap.10aWilson, Woodrow,d1856-1924xInfluence.10aLenin, Vladimir Ilßich,d1870-1924xInfluence.14aWilson, Woodrow,d1856-1924.27aRevolution (Soviet Union : 1917-1921)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01907572 7a1913-19212fast 0aWorld War, 1914-1918xInfluence. 0aNineteen seventeen, A.D. 4aDiplomatic relations.0(OCoLC)fst01907412 4aInfluence (Literary, artistic, etc.)0(OCoLC)fst00972484 4aNineteen seventeen, A.D.0(OCoLC)fst01037811 4aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Presidents & Heads of State. 4aHISTORY / Modern / 20th Century. 4aPOLITICAL SCIENCE / Geopolitics. 0aSoviet UnionxHistoryyRevolution, 1917-1921xInfluence. 0aUnited StatesxForeign relationsy1913-1921. 7aSoviet Union.2fast 7aUnited States.2fast 7aHistory.2fast08iOnline version:aHerman, Arthur, 1956-t1917bFirst edition.dNew York, NY : Harper, 2017z9780062570925w(DLC)  2017039978  aD523 .H3478 2017hHIL-READiS03359994%kONORDER0YBPCAT  a171227b29.99e24.59f376332g1  a40027713991  a972277666a972383286a972404065a981116476  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE01884cam  2200457Ii 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036020003100077020002800108020002700136020002400163035002300187040006500210050002700275082001500302100002900317245003700346250004200383264007000425264001000495300003000505336002600535337002800561338002700589490003700616520036300653650003201016650002401048650004901072650002301121655002801144655002501172655002101197655001801218800005101236949006601287980003401353983001601387985002301403ocn965533013OCoLC20170915091540.6161209t20172017nyu           000 1 eng d  a9781496705723q(paperback)  a1496705726q(paperback)  z9781496705730q(ebook)  z1496705734q(ebook)  a(Sirsi) o965533013  aYDXbengerdacYDXdBTCTAdBDXdIEBdGO9dIUKdMR0dLEBdT7R14aPS3610.A3526bB47 201704a813/.62231 aJackson, K.

But she has finally learned the truth: Brigitta is the lost princess of the kingdom of Tourin. She was sent into hiding as an infant to escape the wrath of her half-brother, the king. And now he knows just where to find her. . .Rupert is a notorious pirate and sorcerer. He's spent most of his life plotting revenge on the evil king and Rupert believes that Brigitta could be the key to finally destroying his enemy.

Jefferson, the optimist with enough faith in the innate goodness of his fellow man to be democracy's champion, was an aristocratic Southern slave owner, while Adams, the overachiever from New England's rising middling classes, painfully aware he was no aristocrat, was a skeptic about popular rule and a defender of a more elitist view of government. They worked closely in the crucible of revolution, crafting the Declaration of Independence and leading, with Franklin, the diplomatic effort that brought France into the fight. But ultimately, their profound differences would lead to a fundamental crisis, in their friendship and writ large in the nation, as they became the figureheads of two entirely new forces, the first American political parties. It was a bitter breach, lasting through the presidential administrations of both men, and beyond. But late in life, something remarkable happened: these two men were nudged into reconciliation. What started as a grudging trickle of correspondence became a great flood, and a friendship was rekindled, over the course of hundreds of letters. In their final years they were the last surviving founding fathers and cherished their role in this mighty young republic as it approached the half century mark in 1826. ... Arguably no relationship in this country's history carries as much freight as that of John Adams of Massachusetts and Thomas Jefferson of Virginia. Gordon Wood has more than done justice to these entwined lives and their meaning; he has written a magnificent new addition to America's collective story."--Dust jacket.10aJefferson, Thomas,d1743-1826xFriends and associates.10aAdams, John,d1735-1826xFriends and associates.14aAdams, Johnd1735-1826xFriends and associates.14aJefferson, Thomasd1743-1826xFriends and associates.17aJefferson, Thomas,d1743-1826.17aAdams, John,d1735-1826. 0aPresidentszUnited StatesvBiography. 0aFounding Fathers of the United StatesvBiography. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmenty1775-1783. 0aUnited StatesxPolitics and governmenty1783-1809. 4aPresidentszUnited StatesvBiography. 7a1775-18092fast 7aBiographies.2fast 7aBiography.2fast 7aBiographies.2lcgft08iOnline version:aWood, Gordon S., author.tFriends divideddNew York : Penguin Press, 2017z9780735224728w(DLC)  2017027494  aC0bNRC04249nam  2200709Ii 45e0001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077020003100094020002800125035002700153037011800180040011000298049001300408050002900421050003000450082001500480100003600495240003100531245006700562264005400629264001000683300002300693336002600716337002800742338002700770505015800797520010800955520139001063650002002453650003002473650003802503650003202541650004502573650004102618650003402659650003102693650004402724650004902768650003102817650004102848650004302889655001902932655003302951655002702984655002503011655002803036655002603064655003403090655002803124655002603152700004403178700003903222700003703261700004803298700005203346700004103398700003803439700005003477994001203527ocn965738096OCoLC20180108043347.0161209t20172017mnu           000 j eng d  a  2017930115  a9781555977887q(paperback)  a155597788Xq(paperback)  a(Sirsi) i9781555977887  bFarrar Straus & Giroux, C/O Mps 16365 James Madison Hwy, Gordonsville, VA, USA, 22942, (540)6727600nSAN 631-5011  aYDXbengerdacYDXdIEPdGP5dJP3dNHPdCZAdIGAdOCLCFdIMTdVP@dOBEdIUKdOVYdT3BdMNJdOKXdVRCdUAB  aNRCCxzc 4aPS3613.A2725243bA6 2017 4aPS3613.A2725243bH47 201704a813/.62231 aMachado, Carmen Maria,eauthor.10aShort stories.kSelections10aHer body and other parties :bstories /cCarmen Maria Machado. 1aMinneapolis, Minnesota :bGraywolf Press,c[2017] 4c√2017  a245 pages ;c21 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier00tThe husband stitch --tInventory --tMothers --tEspecially heinous --tReal women have bodies --tEight bites --tThe resident --tDifficult at parties.  aContains short stories about the realities of women's lives and the violence visited upon their bodies.  a"In Her Body and Other Parties, Carmen Maria Machado blithely demolishes the arbitrary borders between psychological realism and science fiction, comedy and horror, fantasy and fabulism. While her work has earned her comparisons to Karen Russell and Kelly Link, she has a voice that is all her own. In this electric and provocative debut, Machado bends genre to shape startling narratives that map the realities of women's lives and the violence visited upon their bodies.A wife refuses her husband's entreaties to remove the green ribbon from around her neck. A woman recounts her sexual encounters as a plague slowly consumes humanity. A salesclerk in a mall makes a horrifying discovery within the seams of the store's prom dresses. One woman's surgery-induced weight loss results in an unwanted houseguest. And in the bravura novella "Especially Heinous," Machado reimagines every episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, a show we naËively assumed had shown it all, generating a phantasmagoric police procedural full of doppelgËangers, ghosts, and girls with bells for eyes.  Earthy and otherworldly, antic and sexy, queer and caustic, comic and deadly serious, Her Body and Other Parties swings from horrific violence to the most exquisite sentiment. In their explosive originality, these stories enlarge the possibilities of contemporary fiction."--Publisher's description. 0aWomenvFiction. 0aWomenxIdentityvFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aSexual minoritiesvFiction. 4aFICTION / Short Stories (single author). 4aFICTION / Science Fiction / General. 4aQueer relationshipsvFiction. 4aFICTION / Science Fiction. 4aFICTION / Short Stories (single author) 4aMan-woman relationships.0(OCoLC)fst01007080 4aWomen.0(OCoLC)fst01176568 4aWomenxIdentity.0(OCoLC)fst01176807 4aSexual minorities.0(OCoLC)fst01202158 7aFiction.2fast 7aPsychological fiction.2fast 7aScience fiction.2fast 7aShort stories.2fast 7aScience fiction.2gsafd 7aShort stories.2gsafd 7aPsychological fiction.2lcgft 7aScience fiction.2lcgft 7aShort stories.2lcgft12aMachado, Carmen Maria.tHusband stitch.12aMachado, Carmen Maria.tInventory.12aMachado, Carmen Maria.tMothers.12aMachado, Carmen Maria.tEspecially heinous.12aMachado, Carmen Maria.tReal women have bodies.12aMachado, Carmen Maria.tEight bites.12aMachado, Carmen Maria.tResident.12aMachado, Carmen Maria.tDifficult at parties.  aC0bNRC02263nam  2200493 i 45e0001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077020004700094020004400141020003500185035002300220040009800243042000800341049001300349050002600362082001500388084004500403100002900448240003100477245004000508250001900548264004900567264001000616300002300626336002600649337002800675338002700703505060100730520012901331650002901460650003201489655002801521655002801549655002601577655002801603655002801631655002701659655001901686655002701705655002501732994001201757ocn959036128OCoLC20180109083807.0170203t20172017mau           000 j eng    a  2016059748  a9781618731265qhardcover ;qalkaline paper  a1618731262qhardcover ;qalkaline paper  z9781618731272qelectronic book  a(Sirsi) o959036128  aDLCbengerdacDLCdYDXdOCLCQdWIMdOCJdYDXdOCLCOdB@LdTXWBRdT3BdOSUdOCLCFdSFRdOCLCQ  apcc  aNRCCxfb00aPS3619.A4496bA6 201700a813/.6223  aFIC009040aFIC028040aFIC0290002bisacsh1 aSamatar, Sofia,eauthor.10aShort stories.kSelections10aTender :bstories /cSofia Samatar.  aFirst edition. 1aEasthampton, MA :bSmall Beer Press,c[2017] 4c√2017  a273 pages ;c23 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier00tTender bodies.tSelkie stories are for losers ;tOgres of East Africa ;tWalkdog ;tOlimpia's ghost ;tThe tale of Mahliya and Mauhub and the white-footed gazelle ;tHoney bear ;tHow I met the ghoul ;tThose ;tA girl who comes out of a chamber at regular intervals ;tHow to get back to the forest --tTender landscapes.tTender ;tA brief history of nonduality studies ;tDawn and the maiden ;tCities of emerald, deserts of gold ;tAn account of the land of the witches ;tMeet me in Iram ;tRequest for an extension on the Clarity ;tThe closest thing to animals ;tFallow ;tThe red thread.  aA collection of twenty short stories explores the fragility and resilience of bodies, human environments, and familial love. 0aShort stories, American. 0aAnimals, MythicalvFiction. 7aFantasy fiction.2lcgft 7aScience fiction.2lcgft 7aShort stories.2lcgft 7aFantasy fiction.2gsafd 7aScience fiction.2gsafd 7aFantasy fiction.2fast 7aFiction.2fast 7aScience fiction.2fast 7aShort stories.2fast  aC0bNRC02681cam  2200589Ii 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036019001400077020001800091020001500109020001800124035002300142040008000165050002700245082001500272100002600287245003200313264003400345264001100379300002300390336002600413337002800439338002700467520070800494650002201202650002301224650003601247651006901283650004701352650003401399650003301433651004601466650002301512650002201535650003601557651006801593648002001661655004201681655003101723655002801754655004101782655001901823655003001842655001901872655002401891655003501915949006601950980003602016983001602052985002302068ocn980003546OCoLC20170920133150.0161110t20172017enk    e      000 f eng    a962010438  a9781786070395  a1786070391  z9781786070401  a(Sirsi) o980003546  aAU@bengerdacAU@dOCLCOdOCLCFdSINLBdYDXdBDXdATNSHdOCLCAdMR0dKVIJL 4aPR6102.O4884bP53 201704a823.922231 aBolton, Guy,eauthor.14aThe pictures /cGuy Bolton. 1aLondon :bPoint Blank,c2017. 4c√2017.  a389 pages ;c24 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aHollywood 1939. The year that The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind were made. Detective Craine has spent his life working as a studio fixer, whitewashing the misdemeanours and crimes committed by the studio players and stars. But now he's trying to turn his back on that life, following the recent death of his wife, as he's determined to be a better parent to his young son. But then Craine's services are called upon one last time. MGM need him to smooth over the press coverage of the suicide of one of their producers. And soon, what should be a straightforward case proves anything but when connections are made between it and a brutal murder across town. And that's just the start of the story. 0aSuicidevFiction. 0aScandalsvFiction. 0aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 0aHollywood (Los Angeles, Calif.)xHistoryy20th centuryvFiction. 4aMurderxInvestigation.0(OCoLC)fst01029788 4aScandals.0(OCoLC)fst01106361 4aSuicide.0(OCoLC)fst01137578 7aCaliforniazLos AngeleszHollywood.2fast 4aScandalsvFiction. 4aSuicidevFiction. 4aMurderxInvestigationvFiction. 4aHollywood (Los Angeles, Calif)xHistoryy20th centuryvFiction. 7a1900-19992fast 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2lcgft 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aMystery fiction.2gsafd 7aDetective and mystery fiction.2fast 7aFiction.2fast 7aHistorical fiction.2fast 7aHistory.2fast 4aHistorical fiction. 4aDetective and mystery fiction.  aPR6102 .O4884 P53 2017hHIL-READiS03359991$kONORDER0YBPCAT  a171227b24.99e20.49f376332g1  a99974669286  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE03657cam  2200589 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036020002900077020002600106035002300132040003100155043001200186050002600198055002600224082001600250100004100266245005900307250001900366264005300385264001000438300006600448336002600514336003300540337002800573338002700601380003100628520145300659600005102112600002502163650007502188650007302263650007502336650004602411650005602457650005802513650005002571650004302621651002502664655003302689655003202722655002702754655003402781655003102815655003602846655002602882655001902908949006502927980003602992983001603028985002303044ocn953630322OCoLC20170503155328.3170503t20172017quca     6    000 0beng d  a9781770462694qhardcover  a1770462694qhardcover  a(Sirsi) o953630322  aNhCcYBPbengerdacNhCcYBP  an-us--- 4aPS3515.U789bZ57 2017 8aPS3515.U789bB34 201704a813/.522231 aBagge, Peter,eauthor,eillustrator.10aFire!! :bthe Zora Neale Hurston story /cPeter Bagge.  aFirst edition. 1a[Montreal, Qu‚ebec] :bDrawn & Quarterly,c2017. 4c√2017  a71 pages, 30 unnumbered pages :bcolor illustrations ;c23 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aBiographical comics2lcgft  a"Peter Bagge has defied the expectations of the comics industry by changing gears from his famous slacker hero Buddy Bradley to documenting the life and times of historical 20th century trailblazers. If Bagge had not already had a New York Times bestseller with his biography of Margaret Sanger, his newest biography, Fire!!: The Zora Neale Hurston Story, would seem to be an unfathomable pairing of author and subject. Yet through Bagge's skilled cartooning, he turns what could be a rote biography into a bold and dazzling graphic novel, creating a story as brilliant as the life itself. Hurston challenged the norms of what was expected of an African American woman in early 20th century society. The fifth of eight kids from a Baptist family in Alabama, Hurston's writing prowess blossomed at Howard University, and then Barnard College, where she was the sole black student. She arrived in NYC at the height of the Harlem Renaissance and quickly found herself surrounded by peers such as Langston Hughes and Wallace Thurman. Hurston went on to become a noted folklorist and critically acclaimed novelist, including her most provocative work Their Eyes Were Watching God. Despite these landmark achievements, personal tragedies and shifting political winds in the midcentury rendered her almost forgotten by the end of her life. With admiration and respect, Bagge reconstructs her vivid life in resounding full-color."--cProvided by publisher.10aHurston, Zora NealevComic books, strips, etc.14aHurston, Zora Neale. 0aAfrican American women novelistsvBiographyvComic books, strips, etc. 0aAfrican American women authorsvBiographyvComic books, strips, etc. 0aWomen folkloristszUnited StatesvBiographyvComic books, strips, etc. 0aComic books, strips, etc.zUnited States. 4aAfrican American women authors.0(OCoLC)fst00799477 4aAfrican American women novelists.0(OCoLC)fst00799510 4aComic books, strips, etc.0(OCoLC)fst00869145 4aWomen folklorists.0(OCoLC)fst01177689 7aUnited States.2fast 7aComics (Graphic works)2fast 7aBiographical comics.2lcgft 7aGraphic novels.2lcgft 7aComics (Graphic works)2lcgft 7aBiographical comics.2fast 7aComic books, strips, etc.2fast 7aGraphic novels.2fast 4aGraphic books.  aPS3515 .U789 Z57 2017hHIL-READiS03360158QkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180112b21.95e18.00f393965g1  a99974669575  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE02290cam  2200469 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077020002900094020002600123035002300149040010900172042000800281050002400289082001500313084004500328100003600373240003100409245003800440264004000478264001000518300002300528336002600551337002800577338002700605505020500632520045500837650004301292650002301335650004001358650001901398650002401417650004501441650004201486655002601528776012801554949006301682980003601745983001601781985002301797ocn978251639OCoLC20171006054712.6170317t20172017nyu           000 j eng    a  2017007480  a9780735216693qhardcover  a073521669Xqhardcover  a(Sirsi) o978251639  aDLCbengerdacDLCdYDXdBTCTAdBDXdOCLCQdVTLdCZAdIK2dGPIdZHBdJAOdONTdVP@dIUKdTXKYLdVP@dYDX  apcc00aPS3613.C28bA6 201700a813/.6223  aFIC029000aFIC019000aFIC0490002bisacsh1 aMcBride, James,d1957-eauthor.10aShort stories.kSelections10aFive-carat soul /cJames McBride. 1aNew York :bRiverhead Books,c2017. 4c√2017  a308 pages ;c22 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier00tThe under Graham railroad box car set --tBuck boy --tRay-Ray's picture box --tBlub --tGoat --tFather Abe --tThe moaning bench --tThe Christmas dance --tThe fish man angel --tMr. P & the wind.  a"An antiques dealer discovers that a legendary toy commissioned by Civil War General Robert E.

She and Khalil, her college sweetheart, are planning their wedding. They are the perfect couple, "King and Queen of the Racially Nebulous Prom." Their skin is the same shade of beige. They live together in a black bohemian enclave in Brooklyn, where Khalil is riding the wave of the first dot-com boom and Maria is plugging away at her dissertation, on the Jonestown massacre. They've even landed a starring role in a documentary about "new people" like them, who are blurring the old boundaries as a brave new era dawns. Everything Maria knows she should want lies before her--yet she can't stop daydreaming about another man, a poet she barely knows. As fantasy escalates to fixation, it dredges up secrets from the past and threatens to unravel not only Maria's perfect new life but her very persona. 0aRacially mixed peoplevFiction. 0aMan-woman relationshipsvFiction. 0aBrooklyn (New York, N.Y.)vFiction. 1aRacially mixed peoplevFiction. 4aFICTIONxAfrican AmericanxContemporary Women. 4aFICTIONxFamily Life. 4aFICTIONxPolitical. 4aMan-woman relationships.0(OCoLC)fst01007080 4aRacially mixed people.0(OCoLC)fst01086595 7aNew York (State)zNew YorkzBrooklyn.2fast 4aHispanic american students. 4aEducation. 4aEnglish languagexStudy and teaching. 4aLabor supply. 4aMinority students. 7aRomance fiction.2fast 7aFiction.2fast 7aRomances.2gsafd 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft08w(DLC)  2016054539iOnline version:aSenna, Danzy, author.tNew people.dNew York : Riverhead Books,    2017  aPS3569 .E618 N49 2017hHIL-READiS03360392QkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180117b26.00e21.32f400999g1  a99974669172  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE03785cam  2200589 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077019006000094020003000154020002700184020003300211020003000244020001800274020001500292020001800307035002400325037008700349040023700436042000800673043001200681050002700693082001500720084004500735100002700780245005200807264003300859300002300892336002600915337002800941338002700969520162200996650005302618651002602671650002302697650004002720650002802760650005102788651002302839650004002862655001902902655002402921655002802945655002502973655003102998655002503029949006603054980003603120983001603156985002303172on1001340693OCoLC20171128145816.8170816s2017    nyu           000 1 eng    a  2017039315  a962009683a980974665a981581608a1001841673a1002074309  a9781501126062q(hardback)  a1501126067q(hardback)  a9781501126079q(trade paper)  a1501126075q(trade paper)  a9781501176661  a1501176668  z9781501126093  a(Sirsi) o1001340693  bSimon & Schuster, Order Dept 100 Front st, Riverside, NJ, USA, 08075nSAN 200-2442  aDLCbengerdacDLCdAZZPTdYDXdBTCTAdBDXdHQDdVTLdOI6dFMFdDADdIUKdCZAdOEKdTXCVPdRB0dWYZdZP7dCLUdINRdVP@dSINLBdOCLCFdOSUdZHBdTXLBHdOBEdOCLCQdZCUdCHILDdWLUdTXMLRdCTBdANKdT3JdLLCLSdPFLCLdLE#dCN5O4dGYG  apcc  an-us-ms00aPS3623.A7323bS56 201700a813/.6223  aFIC019000aFIC049000aFIC0430002bisacsh1 aWard, Jesmyn,eauthor.10aSing, unburied, sing :ba novel /cJesmyn Ward. 1aNew York :bScribner,c2017.  a289 pages ;c22 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  a"A searing and profound Southern odyssey by National Book Award winner Jesmyn Ward. In Jesmyn Ward's first novel since her National Book Award-winning Salvage the Bones, this singular American writer brings the archetypal road novel into rural twenty-first-century America. Drawing on Morrison and Faulkner, The Odyssey and the Old Testament, Ward gives us an epochal story, a journey through Mississippi's past and present that is both an intimate portrait of a family and an epic tale of hope and struggle. Ward is a major American writer, multiply awarded and universally lauded, and in Sing, Unburied, Sing she is at the height of her powers. Jojo and his toddler sister, Kayla, live with their grandparents, Mam and Pop, and the occasional presence of their drug-addicted mother, Leonie, on a farm on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. Leonie is simultaneously tormented and comforted by visions of her dead brother, which only come to her when she's high; Mam is dying of cancer; and quiet, steady Pop tries to run the household and teach Jojo how to be a man. When the white father of Leonie's children is released from prison, she packs her kids and a friend into her car and sets out across the state for Parchman farm, the Mississippi State Penitentiary, on a journey rife with danger and promise. Sing, Unburied, Sing grapples with the ugly truths at the heart of the American story and the power, and limitations, of the bonds of family. Rich with Ward's distinctive, musical language, Sing, Unburied, Sing is a majestic new work and an essential contribution to American literature"--cProvided by publisher. 0aAfrican American familieszMississippivFiction. 1aMississippivFiction. 4aFICTIONxLiterary. 4aFICTIONxAfrican AmericanxGeneral. 4aFICTIONxComing of Age. 4aAfrican American families.0(OCoLC)fst00799152 7aMississippi.2fast 4aAfrican American familiesvFiction. 7aFiction.2fast 7aRoad fiction.2fast 7aSuspense fiction.2fast 7aRoad fiction.2gsafd 7aThrillers (Fiction)2lcgft 7aRoad fiction.2lcgft  aPS3623 .A7323 S56 2017hHIL-READiS03360367SkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180111b26.00e21.32f394053g1  a99974669337  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE01966cam  2200469 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077019001400094020003100108020002800139035002300167040008200190042001400272050002500286082001600311100003200327245004900359264005400408264001000462300002300472336002600495337002800521338002700549520047900576650002301055650002301078650002201101650002401123650003401147650003401181650003301215650002301248655001901271655003301290655003401323949006401357980003601421983001601457985002301473ocn957021362OCoLC20171123144126.9160817t20172017mnu           000 1 eng d  a  2016951421  a985014657  a9781555977825q(paperback)  a1555977820q(paperback)  a(Sirsi) o957021362  aYDXbengerdacDLCdBDXdDADdCLEdIK2dPFLCLdVP@dOCLCFdIGAdINRdOSUdYDX  alccopycat00aPS3555.V34bS66 201704a813/.542231 aEverett, Percival,eauthor.10aSo much blue :ba novel /cPercival Everett. 1aMinneapolis, Minnesota :bGraywolf Press,c[2017] 4c√2017  a242 pages ;c21 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  a"Kevin Pace's latest painting, like so much of his past, remains a secret.

Aster lives in the lowdeck slums of the HSS Matilda, a space vessel organized much like the antebellum South. For generations, Matilda has ferried the last of humanity to a mythical Promised Land. On its way, the ship's leaders have imposed harsh moral restrictions and deep indignities on dark-skinned sharecroppers like Aster.

She tries to connect these dislocated pieces of her life, and as her mother succumbs to cancer, Thandi searches for an anchor - someone, or something, to love."--cProvided by publisher. 0aAfrican American womenvFiction. 0aMothers and daughtersvFiction. 0aLoss (Psychology)vFiction. 1aMothers and daughtersvFiction. 4aFICTIONxLiterary. 4aFICTIONxAfrican AmericanxGeneral. 4aFICTIONxContemporary Women. 4aAfrican American women.0(OCoLC)fst00799438 4aLoss (Psychology)0(OCoLC)fst01002621 4aMothers and daughters.0(OCoLC)fst01026997 4aMothersxDeathvFiction. 4aGriefvFiction. 4aLoss (Psychology)vFiction. 4aRacially mixed peoplevFiction. 4aIdentity (Psychology)vFiction. 7aBildungsromans.2fast 7aDomestic fiction.2fast 7aFiction.2fast 7aBildungsromans.2gsafd 7aDomestic fiction.2lcgft 7aBildungsromans.2lcgft 4aBildungsromans.08iOnline version:aClemmons, Zinzi.tWhat we lose.dNew York : Viking, 2017z9780735221727w(DLC)  2017029805w(OCoLC)990778390  aPS3603 .L472 W48 2017hHIL-READiS03360250JkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180111b22.00e18.04f394049g1  a99974668832  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE02865cam  2200529 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077020003500094020003200129035002300161040007100184042000800255043001200263050002800275082001600303084004500319100003100364245004400395246003100439250002400470264003200494264001000526300002300536336002600559337002800585338002700613520098100640500002601621650004901647650004601696651005501742650002401797650003401821650003301855650003501888650004001923650003201963651003501995655001902030776014402049949006702193980003602260983001602296985002302312ocn946693503OCoLC20170218050907.5160930t20172016nyu           000 f eng    a  2016039182  a9781250124579qtrade paperback  a1250124573qtrade paperback  a(Sirsi) o946693503  aDLCbengerdacDLCdYDXCPdBTCTAdBDXdOCLCFdIEBdABGdTXMALdYDX  apcc  af-sa---00aPR9369.4.O567bW66 201700a823/.92223  aFIC019000aFIC044000aFIC0510002bisacsh1 aOmotoso, Yewande,eauthor.14aThe woman next door /cYewande Omotoso.34aWoman next door :ba novel  aFirst U.S. edition. 1aNew York :bPicador,c2017. 4c√2016  a280 pages ;c22 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  a"Hortensia James and Marion Agostino are neighbors. One is black, the other white. Both are successful women with impressive careers. Both have recently been widowed, and are living with questions, disappointments, and secrets that have brought them shame. And each has something that the woman next door deeply desires. Sworn enemies, the two share a hedge and a deliberate hostility, which they maintain with a zeal that belies their age. But, one day, an unexpected event forces Hortensia and Marion together. As the physical barriers between them collapse, their bickering gradually softens into conversation, which yields a discovery of shared experiences. But are these sparks of connection enough to ignite a friendship, or is too late to expect these women to change? The U.S. debut of an Etisalat Prize Finalist, The Woman Next Door is a winning story of the common ground we sometimes find in unexpected places, told with wit and wry humor"--cProvided by publisher.  a"A Picador Original." 0aNeighborszSouth AfricazCape TownvFiction. 0aWidowszSouth AfricazCape TownvFiction. 0aCape Town (South Africa)xRace relationsvFiction. 4aFICTION / Literary. 4aFICTION / Contemporary Women. 4aFICTION / Cultural Heritage. 4aNeighbors.0(OCoLC)fst01200293 4aRace relations.0(OCoLC)fst01086509 4aWidows.0(OCoLC)fst01174951 7aSouth AfricazCape Town.2fast 7aFiction.2fast08iOnline version:aOmotoso, Yewande, author.tWoman next doorbFirst U.S. Edition.dNew York : Picador, 2017z9781250124586w(DLC) 2016045453  aPR9369.4 .O567 W66 2017hHIL-READiS03360370MkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180111b16.00e14.24f394097g1  a99974669096  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE03522cam  2200445 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077020002900094020002600123035002300149040008900172042000800261043001200269050002300281082001800304082001700322100003200339245009000371250001900461264003600480264001000516300004500526336002600571337002800597338002700625504006700652505034300719520160501062650004902667650005202716650007302768651005202841651004702893949006102940980003603001983001603037985002303053ocn958799377OCoLC20171220152156.4170731t20172017nyua     b    001 0 eng    a  2017023376  a9780465055920qhardcover  a0465055923qhardcover  a(Sirsi) o958799377  aDLCbengerdacDLCdBTCTAdYDXdOCLCOdBDXdJSEdOCLCQdIK2dBURdFM0dVP@dYDXdNBJ  apcc  an-us---00aHV6789b.M359 201700a364.1097322304a306.09732231 aMay, Elaine Tyler,eauthor.10aFortress America :bhow we embraced fear and abandoned democracy /cElaine Tyler May.  aFirst edition. 1aNew York :bBasic Books,c2017. 4c√2017  avii, 247 pages :billustrations ;c25 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 199-236) and index.0 aIntroduction: The bunker mentality -- Gimme shelter : security in the Atomic Age -- The color of danger : from red to black -- Vigilante virtue : fantasy, reality, and the law -- Women : victims or villains? -- Locked-up America : self-incarceration and the illusion of security -- Epilogue: Back to the future : the twenty-first century.  a"Fear has seeped into every area of American life: Americans own more guns than citizens of any other country, sequester themselves in barricaded houses and gated communities, and retreat from public spaces. And yet, since the 1990s crime rates have plummeted. Why then, are Americans so afraid? In Fortress America, award-winning historian Elaine Tyler May demonstrates how our obsession with security has made citizens fear each other and distrust the government, eroding American democracy. This trend is not merely an aftershock of 9/11--indeed, it dates back to the end of World War II. Cold War anxieties resulted in widespread nuclear panic. Officials encouraged Americans to build bunkers in their backyards and shun anyone they suspected of communist sympathies. In the 1960s and 1970s, Atomic Age anxieties gave way to misplaced fear of crime, leading to a preoccupation with "law and order." The media pointed to black men as dangerous and women as vulnerable, inaccurate claims that nevertheless led to mass incarceration of African Americans and women's exaggerated distrust of strangers. The threat of terrorism is only the most recent in a series of overblown fears that set Americans against each other. With fear on the rise, the concept of citizenship has deteriorated and concern for the common good has all but disappeared. In this remarkable work of history May charts the rise of a muscular national culture grounded in fear. Instead of a thriving democracy of engaged citizens, we have become a paranoid, bunkered, militarized, and divided vigilante nation."--Dust jacket flap. 0aCrimezUnited StatesxHistoryy21st century. 0aViolencezUnited StatesxHistoryy21st century. 0aPublic safetyxSocial aspectszUnited StatesxHistoryy21st century. 0aUnited StatesxSocial conditionsy21st century. 0aUnited StatesxCivilizationy21st century.  aHV6789 .M359 2017hHIL-READiS03360046MkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180108b30.00e24.60f385157g1  a40027778773  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE03182cam  2200589 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077019002500094020002900119020002600148024001600174035002300190040008100213042000800294043001200302050002500314082001600339084004500355100003900400245006400439250003800503264003300541264001000574300002300584336002600607337002800633338002700661520113700688650002401825650002601849650002301875651007201898651002301970651002701993648002002020655003102040655003102071655003102102655003102133655003102164655001902195655003002214655001902244655002802263776016202291949006402453980003602517983001602553985002302569ocn986202780OCoLC20170829065020.6170530t20172016nyu           000 1 eng    a  2017022622  a985960891a986386335  a9781501163876 (hardback)  a1501163876 (hardback)8 a99972738838  a(Sirsi) o986202780  aDLCbengerdacDLCdVTLdCLEdOCJdYDXdOCLCFdWIMVLdB@LdTXWALdTXLPLdRB0  apcc  an-us-ny00aPR6119.P84bG65 201700a823/.92223  aFIC019000aFIC014000aFIC0000002bisacsh1 aSpufford, Francis,d1964-eauthor.10aGolden Hill :ba novel of old New York /cFrancis Spufford.  aFirst Scribner hardcover edition. 1aNew York :bScribner,c2017. 4c√2016  a302 pages ;c24 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  a"New York, a small town on the tip of Manhattan island, 1746. One rainy evening in November, a handsome young stranger fresh off the boat arrives at a countinghouse door on Golden Hill Street: this is Mr. Smith, amiable, charming, yet strangely determined to keep suspicion shimmering. For in his pocket, he has what seems to be an order for a thousand pounds, a huge sum, and he won't explain why, or where he comes from, or what he is planning to do in the colonies that requires so much money. Should the New York merchants trust him? Should they risk their credit and refuse to pay? Should they befriend him, seduce him, arrest him; maybe even kill him? Rich in language and historical perception, yet compulsively readable, Golden Hill is a story "taut with twists and turns" that "keeps you gripped until its tour-de-force conclusion" (The Times, London). Spufford paints an irresistible picture of a New York provokingly different from its later metropolitan self but already entirely a place where a young man with a fast tongue can invent himself afresh, fall in love--and find a world of trouble"--cProvided by publisher. 4aFICTION / Literary. 4aFICTION / Historical. 4aFICTION / General. 0aNew York (State)xHistoryyColonial period, ca. 1600-1775vFiction. 4aNew YorkvFiction. 7aNew York (State)2fast 7a1600-17752fast 7aHistorical fiction.2gsafd 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft 7aThrillers (Fiction)2lcgft 7aPicaresque fiction.2lcgft 7aHistorical fiction.2sears 7aFiction.2fast 7aHistorical fiction.2fast 7aHistory.2fast 7aSuspense fiction.2fast08iOnline version:aSpufford, Francis, 1964- author.tGolden HillbFirst Scribner hardcover edition.dNew York : Scribner, 2017z9781501163890w(DLC) 2017026413  aPR6119 .P84 G65 2017hHIL-READiS03360050HkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180108b26.00e21.32f385157g1  a99974668803  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE03115cam  2200517 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077019002500094020002900119020002600148035002300174040011000197041001300307042000800320050002400328082001800352084004500370100004100415240002000456245018300476264004800659300006100707336002600768336003300794337002800827338002700855520101700882650002001899650003901919650004901958650003802007650004002045655003302085655003402118700002602152700004502178700004202223700003102265776016302296949006302459980003602522983001602558985002302574ocn982373752OCoLC20171211192400.7170412s2017    nyua     6    000 1 eng    a  2017000261  a957680597a961156010  a9781681371078qhardcover  a1681371073qhardcover  a(Sirsi) o982373752  aDLCbengerdacDLCdOCLCOdYDXdBTCTAdBDXdOCLCFdNHPdOCLdOCLCOdCUYdNYPdVP@dOCLCQdYDXdOCLCOdOCL1 aenghfre  apcc00aPN6747.C53bA2 201700a741.5/944223  aCGN006000aCGN008000aCGN0040302bisacsh1 aClaveloux, Nicole,eauthor,eartist.10aWorks.lEnglish14aThe green hand and other stories /cNicole Claveloux ; with Edith Zha ; introduction by Daniel Clowes ; translated by Donald Nicholson-Smith ; English lettering by Dustin Harbin. 1aNew York :bNew York Review Comics,c[2017]  a100 pages :bchiefly illustrations (some color) ;c29 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  a"Nicole Claveloux's short stories--originally published in the late 1970s and never before collected in English--are among the most beautiful comics ever created: whimsical, intoxicating, with the freshness and splendor of dreams. In hallucinatory color or elegant black-and-white, she brings us into lands that are very different from our own but oddly recognizable. They are lands filled with murderous grandmothers and lonely city dwellers, bad-tempered vegetables and walls that are surprisingly easy to fall through, lands in which the very air seems alive and capable of telling you a dirty joke (or the meaning of life). In the title story, a new houseplant becomes the first step in an epic journey of self-discovery and a witty fable of modern romance--complete with talking shrubbery, infantile gourmands, a wised-up genie, and one very depressed bird. This new selection is the perfect introduction to the work of an unforgettable, unjustly neglected master of French comics"--cProvided by publisher. 0aGraphic novels. 4aCOMICS & GRAPHIC NOVELSxLiterary. 4aCOMICS & GRAPHIC NOVELSxContemporary Women. 4aCOMICS & GRAPHIC NOVELSxFantasy. 4aGraphic novels.0(OCoLC)fst00946656 7aComics (Graphic works)2fast 7aComics (Graphic works)2lcgft1 aZha, ‚Edith,eauthor.1 aClowes, Daniel,ewriter of introduction.1 aNicholson-Smith, Donald,etranslator.1 aHarbin, Dustin,eletterer.08iOnline version:aClaveloux, Nicole, author, artist.tGreen hand and other stories.dNew York : New York Review Comics, [2017]z9781681371085w(DLC) 2017017926  aPN6747 .C53 A2 2017hHIL-READiS03360049PkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180108b24.95e20.46f385157g1  a40027713995  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE01989cam  2200457Ii 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036020003100077020002800108035002400136040006000160041001300220050002900233082002100262100003500283240003400318245011200352250003400464264005000498300003900548336002100587337002500608338002300633520026700656600002600923650004000949650005600989650004101045650002701086650005001113650007401163650005801237655002801295700003101323700003401354949006801388980003601456983001601492985002301508on1013189364OCoLC20171211082152.4171128r20172017nyua          000 0aeng d  a9780316466622q(hardcover)  a031646662Xq(hardcover)  a(Sirsi) o1013189364  aCGLbengerdacCGLdCGLdOCLCOdBDXdZQPdZHBdJAIdCZA1 aenghfre14aHV6626.54.F8bJ8513 201704a362.76092aB2231 aJulien, Maude,d1957-eauthor.10aDerri·ere la grille.lEnglish14aThe only girl in the world :ba memoir /cMaude Julien with Ursula Gauthier ; translated by Adriana Hunter.  aFirst North American edition. 1aNew York :bLittle, Brown and Company,c2017.  a273 pages :billustration ;c22 cm  atext2rdacontent  aunmediated2rdamedia  avolume2rdacarrier  aThe Only Girl in the World describes the author's harrowing upbringing by fanatic parents, who raised her in isolation through traumatic disciplinary exercises designed to "eliminate weakness" and recounts how she eventually escaped with the help of an outsider.10aJulien, Maude,d1957- 0aAbused childrenzFrancevBiography. 0aPsychologically abused childrenzFrancevBiography. 0aAdult child abuse victims' writings. 0aPsychological torture. 4aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Personal Memoirs. 4aPSYCHOLOGY / Psychopathology / Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). 4aPSYCHOLOGY / Psychopathology / Personality Disorders. 7aAutobiographies.2lcgft1 aGauthier, Ursula,eauthor.1 aHunter, Adriana,etranslator.  aHV6626.54 .F8 J8513 2017hHIL-READiS03360048OkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180108b27.00e22.14f385157g1  a40027759063  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE03966cam  2200529 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077019002600094020002900120020002600149035002400175040009200199042000800291043001200299050002400311082001400335084003400349100002900383245010600412250004100518264003600559264001000595300002600605336002600631337002800657338002700685505036000712520151701072520022502589600002002814650002602834650002502860650002902885650005202914650003202966650006502998650004503063650005503108655002803163776010803191949006203299980003603361983001603397985002303413on1000150468OCoLC20171010065851.3170804t20172017nyu           000 0aeng    a  2017018270  a962009685a1003742485  a9781501129957qhardcover  a1501129953qhardcover  a(Sirsi) o1000150468  aDLCbengerdacDLCdOCLCOdYDXdBTCTAdBDXdGK8dJAIdCO2dFM0dCZAdYDXdVP@dEHHdJOY  apcc  an-us---00aGV1469.3b.W57 201700a794.8223  aGAM013000aBIO0050002bisacsh1 aWilliams, Walt,eauthor.10aSignificant zero :bheroes, villains, and the fight for art and soul in video games /cWalt Williams.  aFirst Atria Books hardcover edition. 1aNew York :bAtria Books,c2017. 4c√2017  ax, 290 pages ;c24 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier0 aTutorial -- God, lies, and video games -- Breaking in -- Eat shit or die trying -- The cruel tutelage of Peter Griffin -- Enraptured -- Made men -- Lost at sea -- Significant zero -- Character flaws -- Walking the line -- We are not heroes -- Development never changes -- Airplanes -- Into darkness -- Not the fall but the stop -- Epilogue: New game plus.  a"From the award-winning videogame writer behind Spec Ops: The Line comes an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at how today's blockbuster video games are made. When his satirical musings in a college newspaper got him discharged from the Air Force, it became clear to Walt Williams that his destiny in life was to be a writer--he just never thought he'd end up writing video games, let alone working on some of the most successful franchises in the industry--Bioshock, Civilization, Borderlands, and Mafia among others. Williams pulls back the curtain on an astonishingly profitable industry that has put its stamp on pop culture and yet is little known to those outside its walls. In his reflective yet comically-observant voice, Williams walks you through his unlikely and at times inglorious rise within one of the world's top gaming companies, exposing an industry abundant in brain power and out-sized egos, but struggling to stay innovative. Significant Zero also provides clear-eyed criticism of the industry's addiction to violence and explains how the role of the narrative designer--the poor soul responsible for harmonizing gameplay with storylines--is crucial for expanding the scope of video games into more immersive and emotional experiences. Significant Zero offers a rare look inside this fascinating, billion-dollar industry and a path forward for its talented men and women--gamers and nongamers alike--that imagines how video games might inspire the best in all of us"--cProvided by publisher.  a"An award-winning videogame writer offers a rare behind-the-scenes look inside the gaming industry, and expands on how games are transformed from mere toys into meaningful, artistic experiences"--cProvided by publisher.10aWilliams, Walt. 0aVideo games industry. 0aVideo gamesxDesign. 0aViolence in video games. 0aVideo game designerszUnited StatesvBiography. 4aGAMES / Video & Electronic. 4aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Entertainment & Performing Arts. 4aGAMES & ACTIVITIES / Video & Electronic. 4aBUSINESS & ECONOMICS / Industries / Entertainment. 7aAutobiographies.2lcgft08iOnline version:aWilliams, Walt, author.tSignificant zerodNew York : Atria Books, 2017z9781501129971  aGV1469.3 .W57 2017hHIL-READiS03360047NkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180108b26.00e21.32f385157g1  a99974669335  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE03552nam  2200589 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036020002900077020002600106035002300132040003100155043001200186050002400198082001500222100004800237245004800285246003100333250001900364264005200383264001000435300004800445336002600493336003300519337002800552338002700580520143000607504004102037650006902078650007402147650006802221600006102289600003502350650003602385650004302421650003702464651002502501648002002526655003202546655003002578655003402608655002702642655003102669655003602700655003302736655002602769655002902795949006302824980003602887983001602923985002302939ocn951552614OCoLC20170221154701.5170221t20172017quca     6b   000 0beng d  a9781770462670qpaperback  a1770462678qpaperback  a(Sirsi) o951552614  aNhCcYBPbengerdacNhCcYBP  an-us--- 4aPN4874.S4bO45 201704a070.922231 aOllmann, Joe,d1966-eauthor,eillustrator.14aThe abominable Mr. Seabrook /cJoe Ollmann.3 aAbominable Mister Seabrook  aFirst edition. 1a[Montreal, Quebec] :bDrawn & Quarterly,c2017. 4c√2017  a296 pages :bchiefly illustrations ;c23 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  a"In the early twentieth century, travel writing represented the desire for the expanding bourgeoisie to experience the exotic cultures of the world past their immediate surroundings. Journalist William Buehler Seabrook was emblematic of this trend--participating in voodoo ceremonies, riding camels cross the Sahara desert, communing with cannibals and most notably, popularizing the term 'zombie' in the West. A string of his bestselling books show an engaged, sympathetic gentleman hoping to share these strange, hidden delights with the rest of the world. He was willing to go deeper than any outsider had before. But, of course, there was a dark side. Seabrook was a barely functioning alcoholic who was deeply obsessed with bondage and the so-called mystical properties of pain and degradation. His life was a series of traveling highs and drunken lows; climbing on and falling off the wagon again and again. What led the popular and vivid writer to such a sad state? Cartoonist Joe Ollmann spent seven years researching Seabrook's life, interviewing surviving family and accessing long neglected archives, in order to piece together the peripatetic life of a forgotten American writer. Often weaving in Seabrook's own words and those of his biographers, Ollmann posits Seabrook the believer versus Seabrook the exploiter, and leaves the reader to consider where one ends and the other begins."--cProvided by publisher.  aIncludes bibliographical references. 0aJournalistszUnited StatesvBiographyvComic books, strips, etc. 0aAuthors, Americany20th centuryvBiographyvComic books, strips, etc. 0aAlcoholicszUnited StatesvBiographyvComic books, strips, etc.10aSeabrook, William,d1884-1945vComic books, strips, etc.14aSeabrook, William,d1884-1945. 4aAlcoholics.0(OCoLC)fst00804414 4aAuthors, American.0(OCoLC)fst00821764 4aJournalists.0(OCoLC)fst00984188 7aUnited States.2fast 7a1900-19992fast 7aBiographical comics.2lcgft 7aNonfiction comics.2lcgft 7aComics (Graphic works)2lcgft 7aGraphic novels.2lcgft 7aBiographical comics.2fast 7aComic books, strips, etc.2fast 7aComics (Graphic works)2fast 7aGraphic novels.2fast 7aNonfiction comics.2fast  aPN4874 .S4 O45 2017hHIL-READiS03360052JkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180108b22.95e20.43f385159g1  a99974669593  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE02061cam  2200469 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077020004500094020004200139035002400181040006500205042000800270043001200278050002500290082001600315100002800331245004100359250001900400264007400419264001000493300002300503336002600526337002800552338002700580520030200607500013000909650003101039650003501070650004101105651003401146650002401180650002701204650003401231655001901265776016801284949006401452980003601516983001601552985002301568on1004490778OCoLC20171208201010.9171012t20172017ncu           000 f eng    a  2017045571  a9781616208424qpaperbackqalkaline paper  a1616208422qpaperbackqalkaline paper  a(Sirsi) o1004490778  aCoCr/DLCbengerdacDLCdOCLCOdIZ2dRB0dGK8dCZAdZHBdYDX  apcc  ae-uk-en00aPR6113.O97bE46 201704a823/.922231 aMozley, Fiona,eauthor.10aElmet :ba novel /cby Fiona Mozley.  aFirst edition. 1aChapel Hill, North Carolina :bAlgonquin Books of Chapel Hill,c2017. 4c√2017  a312 pages ;c21 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  a"Cathy and Daniel live in the remote woods of Yorkshire with their gentle brute of a father, a former enforcer who now wants only to be left alone to raise his children.

Jack is an anti-patent scientist turned drug pirate, traversing the world in a submarine as a pharmaceutical Robin Hood, fabricating cheap scrips for poor people who can't otherwise afford them. But her latest drug hack has left a trail of lethal overdoses as people become addicted to their work, doing repetitive tasks until they become unsafe or insane. Hot on her trail, an unlikely pair: Eliasz, a brooding military agent, and his robotic partner, Paladin. As they race to stop information about the sinister origins of Jack's drug from getting out, they begin to form an uncommonly close bond that neither of them fully understand. And underlying it all is one fundamental question: Is freedom possible in a culture where everything, even people, can be owned? 0aDrugsxSide effectsvFiction. 0aDrugsvFiction. 0aRobotsvFiction. 0aScientistsvFiction. 0aSmugglersvFiction. 4aFICTION / Science Fiction / Hard Science Fiction. 4aFICTION / Science Fiction / Genetic Engineering. 4aFICTION / Science Fiction / Cyberpunk. 4aDrugs.0(OCoLC)fst00898761 4aDrugsxSide effects.0(OCoLC)fst00898912 4aRobots.0(OCoLC)fst01099038 4aScientists.0(OCoLC)fst01108895 4aSmugglers.0(OCoLC)fst01121772 1aRobotsvFiction. 1aDrug trafficvFiction. 7aScience fiction.2lcgft 7aScience fiction.2gsafd 7aFiction.2fast 7aScience fiction.2fast  aPS3614 .E588 A95 2017hHIL-READiS03360092NkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180112b25.99e21.31f393955g1  a99974669616  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE02703cam  2200541Ii 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036019002500077020003100102020002800133035002300161040012500184050002800309082000800337100002900345245003800374250001900412264007300431264001000504300002300514336002600537337002800563338002300591520086600614650002901480650003101509650002501540650002901565650004201594650004001636650003601676650004001712650001301752655002701765655003101792655003401823655002901857655002701886655001901913655002601932655003301958655002801991949006702019980003602086983001602122985002302138ocn957636592OCoLC20170729052050.5160905t20172017nyu           000 1 eng d  a987330286a988633853  a9780062259684q(hardcover)  a0062259687q(hardcover)  a(Sirsi) o957636592  aYDXbengerdacYDXdBTCTAdBDXdOCLCQdHQDdKVIJLdOCLCOdWIMdTXGdBYNdGO6dNPCdLEBdILCdOCLCOdVP@dOCLCFdIGAdIUK14aPS3613.A43535bB53 2017 4a8131 aMalerman, Josh,eauthor.10aBlack mad wheel /cJosh Malerman.  aFirst edition. 1aNew York, NY :bEcco, an imprint of HarperCollinsPublishers,c[2017] 4c√2017  a291 pages ;c24 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolume2rdacarrier  aThe Danes--the band known as the "Darlings of Detroit"--are washed up and desperate for inspiration, eager to once again have a number one hit. That is, until an agent from the US Army approaches them. Will they travel to an African desert and track down the source of a mysterious and malevolent sound? Under the guidance of their front man, Philip Tonka, the Danes embark on a harrowing journey through the scorching desert--a trip that takes Tonka into the heart of an ominous and twisted conspiracy. Meanwhile, in a nondescript Midwestern hospital, a nurse named Ellen tends to a patient recovering from a near-fatal accident. The circumstances that led to his injuries are mysterious--and his body heals at a remarkable rate.

Cheech the storyteller takes the reader on a wild ride along his strange and wonderful path to fame that saw the son of a policeman become the face of the recreational drug movement. He describes his early artistic aspirations to become a potter, his brief stint as a magazine reporter when he interviewed Little Richard, and his surreal and unlikely ascent to the top of the comedy world. Cheech also details how his passion for Chicano art led him to assemble the world's finest private collection, and how he bested the likes of Anderson Cooper to win Celebrity Jeopardy! Written with his trademark comedic flair and replete with colorful characters both famous and obscure, this is a fresh, funny, and unstintingly honest account of an incredible life and career that represents a "new high" in autobiography.--From book jacket.10aMarin, Cheech.14aMarin, Cheech. 0aComedianszUnited StatesvBiography. 0aMotion picture actors and actresseszUnited StatesvBiography. 0aHispanic American motion picture actors and actressesvBiography. 4aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHYxEntertainment & Performing Arts. 4aComedians.0(OCoLC)fst00869077 4aHispanic American motion picture actors and actresses.0(OCoLC)fst00957421 4aMotion picture actors and actresses.0(OCoLC)fst01027096 7aUnited States.2fast 4aBiography. 4aAutobiographies. 7aAutobiographies.2fast 7aBiography.2fast 7aAutobiographies.2lcgft1 aHassan, John,eauthor.  aPN2287 .M483 A3 2016hHIL-READiS03360080KkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180112b27.00e22.14f393955g1  a99974668606  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE03423cam  2200685 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077019002500094020004800119020004500167020004800212020004500260020001800305020001500323035002300338040010900361042000800470050002700478082001600505084003400521100003300555245003900588250001900627264003600646300002400682336002600706337002800732338002700760490003300787520100800820650002801828650002001856650002001876650003601896650003301932650003101965650003101996650003902027650003802066650002102104651003502125655002802160655002802188655002702216655002702243655002702270655002702297655001902324655002802343655002802371655002802399776012102427800004802548949006602596980003602662983001602698985002302714ocn957077720OCoLC20170328071954.5160819s2017    nyu           000 1 eng    a  2016029456  a939706607a967385827  a9781481429719 (hardcover : acid-free paper)  a148142971X (hardcover : acid-free paper)  a9781481429726 (softcover : acid-free paper)  a1481429728 (softcover : acid-free paper)  z9781481249733  z1481249738  a(Sirsi) o957077720  aDLCbengerdacDLCdORXdOCLCFdTXNdZQPdGO6dCGPdIHXdOU9dCZAdVP@dYDXdMCTdYDXCPdBDXdBTCTAdDF$  apcc00aPS3557.I4545bC64 201700a813/.54223  aFIC009030aFIC0090002bisacsh1 aGilman, Laura Anne,eauthor.14aThe cold eye /cLaura Anne Gilman.  aFirst Edition. 1aNew York :bSaga Press,c[2017]  a334 pages ;c24 cm.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier1 aThe Devil's West ;vbook two  a"In the anticipated sequel to Silver on the Road, Isobel is riding circuit through the Territory as the Devil's Left Hand.

Along with her mentor, Gabriel, she is traveling circuit through Flood to represent the power of the Devil and uphold the agreement he made with the people to protect them.

Orwell, of course. The digital era he never glimpsed has had unfortunate effects on understanding. Ugly words and phrases are picked up by the unwary and passed on like a virus. Cryptic assertion supplants explanation and reasoned argument. Muddle and contradiction suffocate meaning. You will write better--and have fun--with the original approaches of an editor experienced in ridding prose of corrupting predators: learn to recognize the infiltrators, the flesh-eaters. and the zombies. But watch, too, as Harry Evans identifies the magic potions mixed by the best of prose writers. He has spent his life clarifying complexities, from the tragic poisoning of thalidomide babies to the urgent files from battlefield reporters and his political histories. Make yourself clear with a trustworthy editor at your side."--Jacket. 0aEnglish languagexRhetoric. 0aEnglish languagexGrammar. 0aEnglish languagexUsage. 4aEnglish languagexGrammar.0(OCoLC)fst00911209 4aEnglish languagexRhetoric.0(OCoLC)fst00911581 4aEnglish languagexUsage.0(OCoLC)fst00911918  aPE1408 .E83 2017hHIL-READiS03360097SkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180112b27.00e22.14f393955g1  a99974668590  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE02282cam  2200517Ii 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077019004800094020003100142020002800173024001600201035002300217040010700240043001200347050002600359082001800385100003100403245003100434264004800465264001000513300005900523336003300582336002600615337002800641338002700669520043600696650004801132650004101180650003801221650005201259650005201311650004601363650005001409651002501459655003401484655002701518655002001545655003301565655002601598949006501624980003601689983001601725985002301741ocn979561216OCoLC20170913043914.1170328s2017    waua     6    000 1 eng d  a  2016947861  a951925419a987269048a991810928a1001262388  a9781606999912q(hardcover)  a1606999915q(hardcover)8 a99972588620  a(Sirsi) o979561216  aIG$bengerdacIG$dOCLCOdYDXCPdBTCTAdBDXdOCLCQdOCLCOdDLCdOCLCOdLNCdZCUdNUIdOCLCFdPAUdOCO  an-us--- 4aPN6727.M313bE27 201704a741.5/9732231 aMalkasian, Cathy,eauthor.10aEartha /cCathy Malkasian. 1aSeattle, WA :bFantagraphics Books,c[2017] 4c√2017  a255 pages :bchiefly color illustrations ;c25 x 30 cm  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aFor a thousand years, the unfinished dreams from the City Across the Sea came to Echo Fjord to find sanctuary.

Isolated at home and an outlander at school, Linda is drawn to the enigmatic, attractive Lily and new history teacher Mr. Grierson. When Mr. Grierson is charged with possessing child pornography, the implications of his arrest deeply affect Linda as she wrestles with her own fledgling desires and craving to belong. And then the young Gardner family moves in across the lake and Linda finds herself welcomed into their home as a babysitter for their little boy, Paul. It seems that her life finally has purpose but with this new sense of belonging she is also drawn into secrets she doesn't understand. Over the course of a few days, Linda makes a set of choices that reverberate throughout her life. As she struggles to find a way out of the sequestered world into which she was born, Linda confronts the life-and-death consequences of the things people do-and fail to do-for the people they love.

Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, writing of this small group of Mormon women who've previously been seen as mere names and dates, has brilliantly reconstructed these textured, complex lives to give us a fulsome portrait of who these women were and of their "sex radicalism"--The idea that a woman should choose when and with whom to bear children."--Publisher's description.20aChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day SaintsxHistoryxSources. 0aMormonsxDiaries. 0aFamiliesxReligious life. 0aFamiliesxReligious aspectsxChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 0aFamiliesxReligious aspectsxMormon Church. 0aMormon ChurchxHistoryxSources. 4aFamiliesxReligious life. 4aFamiliesxReligious aspectsxChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 4aFamiliesxReligious aspectsxMormon Church. 4aHISTORY / United States / 19th Century. 4aRELIGION / Christianity / Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon) 4aSOCIAL SCIENCE / Women's Studies.  aBX8693 .U47 2017hHIL-READiS03360089TkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180112b35.00e28.70f393955g1  a99974668630  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE02145cam  2200505Ii 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036020001800077020001500095035002300110040008300133043001200216050002500228082001600253100003100269245003600300250001900336264003700355300002300392336002600415337002800441338002700469520052000496650002301016651003101039650002401070650002201094650002201116650002701138650005001165650006001215650003801275650002401313650003401337651002701371655002801398655002801426655002701454655001901481949006401500980003601564983001601600985002301616ocn951453123OCoLC20170314053453.0160608s2017    cau           000 1 eng d  a9781616962487  a1616962488  a(Sirsi) o951453123  aYDXCPbengcYDXCPdBDXdBTCTAdOCLCQdHQDdWIMdVTLdIH9dKL8dFDBdIGAdOCLCF  ae-it---14aPS3552.E13bI53 201704a813/.542231 aBeagle, Peter S.,eauthor.10aIn Calabria /cPeter S.

Above all, his is a seeker's story, a pilgrimage in search of a set of principles to live by. That search took Nesmith from a childhood in Dallas, where his single mother Bette invented Liquid Paper, to the set of The Monkees in Los Angeles; to the heart of swinging London with John Lennon and Jimi Hendrix; and to an unexpected oasis of brilliance in the Santa Fe desert, where his friendships with Douglas Adams and Los Alamos scientists would point him toward the power of the infinite and the endless possibilities of human connection. This funny, thoughtful, self-aware book is a window onto an unexpected life, inflected at every turn by the surprising candor and absurdist humor of an American original. Opening Infinite Tuesday is like stepping into the world of Michael Nesmith, where something curious is always unfolding, and where riffs on everything from bands to dogs to the nature of reality make for an endlessly engaging journey."--Jacket.10aNesmith, Michael.14aNesmith, Michael. 0aRock musicianszUnited StatesvBiography. 4aRock musicians.0(OCoLC)fst01099238 7aUnited States.2fast 4aRock musicianszUnited StatesvBiography. 7aAutobiographies.2fast 7aBiography.2fast 7aAutobiographies.2lcgft  aML420 .N456 A3 2017hHIL-READiS03360095QkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180112b28.00e22.96f393955g1  a99974668787  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE01974cam  2200505 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077020002600094020002300120035002300143040007000166042001400236050002500250082001600275100003900291245004800330250001900378264003200397300002400429336002600453337002800479338002700507490003100534500003700565520025900602650002100861650005700882650001900939650005000958650003201008655004201040655001901082655002701101655002801128655004301156655002801199655004301227800005901270949006401329980003601393983001601429985002301445ocn994007730OCoLC20171123145633.3171023s2017    nyu           000 1 eng d  a  2017288932  a9780765379207q(hbk.)  a0765379201q(hbk.)  a(Sirsi) o994007730  aJBLbengerdacDLCdJBLdORXdOCJdVP@dOCLCFdCZAdYDXdIGAdGO3  alccopycat00aPR6103.H76bK55 201704a823/.922231 aChristopher, Adam,d1978-eauthor.10aKilling is my business /cAdam Christopher.  aFirst edition. 1aNew York, NY :bTOR,c2017.  a284 pages ;c22 cm.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier1 aA Ray Electromatic mystery  a"A Tom Doherty Associates book."  aAnother golden morning in a seedy town, and a new memory tape and assignment for intrepid PI-turned-hitman--and last robot left in working order--Raymond Electromatic.

In the summer of 2012 a woman named Eva was found dead in the London townhouse she shared with her husband, Hans K. Rausing. The couple had struggled with drug addiction for years, often under the glare of tabloid headlines. Now, writing with singular clarity and restraint, Hans' sister, the editor and publisher Sigrid Rausing, tries to make sense of what happened. In Mayhem, she asks the difficult questions those close to the world of addiction must face. "Who can help the addict, consumed by a shaming hunger, a need beyond control? There is no medicine: the drugs are the medicine. And who can help their families, so implicated in the self-destruction of the addict? Who can help when the very notion of help becomes synonymous with an exercise of power; a familial police state; an end to freedom, in the addicts mind?" An eloquent and timely attempt to understand the conundrum of addiction and a memoir as devastating as it is riveting.10aRausing, SigridxHealth. 0aDrug addictsvBiography. 0aDrug abusevBiography. 0aFamiliesvBiography. 2aSubstance-Related Disorders. 2aDrug Users. 4aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHYxPersonal Memoirs. 4aFAMILY & RELATIONSHIPSxDysfunctional Families. 4aPSYCHOLOGYxPsychopathologyxAddiction. 2aPersonal Narratives. 7aAutobiographies.2lcgft08iOnline version:aRausing, Sigrid.tMayhem.bFirst edition.dNew York : Alfred A.

When Amanda Gallo, fresh from the backwater of local TV, lands the job of her dreams at FAIR News--the coveted morning anchor slot--she's finally made it: a six-figure salary, wardrobe allowance, plenty of on-air face time, and a chance to realize her dreams, not to mention buy herself lunch. Amanda Wakes Up takes off as Amanda feels for the first time that she can make her mom and her best friend proud and think about an actual future with her boyfriend, Charlie. But she finds her journalistic ideals shredded as she struggles to keep up with the issues in a ratings-crazed madhouse--battling for hair and makeup time, coping with her sexist (but scathingly handsome) coanchor, Rob, mixing up the headlines with pajama modeling on the street, and showing Benji Diggs, her media maestro boss, that she's got what it takes. As the news heats up in a hotly contested election season and a wild-card candidate, former Hollywood actor Victor Fluke, appears on the scene, Amanda's pressure-cooker job gets hotter as her personal life unravels. Walking a knife's edge between ambition and survival, and about to break the biggest story of her career, Amanda must decide what she's willing to give up to get ahead--and what she needs to hold on to to save herself"--cProvided by publisher. 0aTelevision personalitiesvFiction. 0aWomen journalistsvFiction. 4aFICTIONxContemporary Women. 4aFICTIONxSatire. 4aTelevision personalities.0(OCoLC)fst01146966 4aWomen journalists.0(OCoLC)fst01178072 4aWomen journalistsvFiction. 4aTelevision broadcasting of newsvFiction. 4aElectionsvFiction. 7aFiction.2fast 7aRomance fiction.2fast 7aLove stories.2gsafd 7aSatire.2gsafd 7aRomance fiction.2lcgft08iOnline version:aCamerota, Alisyn.tAmanda wakes up.dNew York : Viking, 2017z9780399564017w(DLC)  2017032873  aPS3603 .A4537 A83 2017hHIL-READiS03360085PkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180112b26.00e21.32f393960g1  a99974669602  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE03433cam  2200709 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077019004700094020004300141020004000184020002600224035002300250040014200273042000800415043001200423050002500435082001600460084001200476100003400488245006300522250001900585264004200604300002400646336002600670337002800696338002700724490002100751520023500772520054501007600008601552600007701638600008401715600008601799650003601885651005601921650004601977650003202023651001902055651002502074650002802099650002602127650002102153650003602174651005602210648002002266655003302286655003102319655003202350655001902382655003002401655001902431655003302450655003102483655002602514800004402540949006402584980003602648983001602684985002302700ocn957598017OCoLC20170802061533.6170306s2017    nyu           000 1 eng    a  2017010964  a980912072a986827188a987270099a988633632  a9781101966518 (hardcover : alk. paper)  a1101966513 (hardcover : alk. paper)  z9781101966525 (ebook)  a(Sirsi) o957598017  aDLCbengerdacDLCdYDXdBTCTAdBDXdOCLCFdQX9dIZ2dIUKdILCdVP@dIGAdWIMVLdDYJdFLWMDdTNHdIUOdOCJdPFLCLdD9MdTOHdCALHPdOCLCO  apcc  ae-uk-en00aPR6123.E36bA55 201700a823/.92223  aFIC WEI1 aWeir, Alison,d1951-eauthor.10aAnne Boleyn, a king's obsession :ba novel /cAlison Weir.  aFirst edition. 1aNew York :bBallantine Books,c[2017]  a541 pages ;c24 cm.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier1 aSix Tudor queens  aHenry VIII is risking his marriage and the political strategies of Cardinal Wolsey in his obsession to marry Anne Boleyn, who does not welcome the king's advances and loathes the cardinal for breaking her betrothal to Harry Percy.  aAnne is barely a teenager when she is sent from her family's Hever Castle to serve at the royal court of the Netherlands.

In the eerily warm spring of 1846, George Donner placed this advertisement in a local newspaper as he and a restless caravan prepared for what they hoped would be the most rewarding journey of a lifetime. But in eagerly pursuing what would a century later become known as the "American dream, " this optimistic-yet-motley crew of emigrants was met with a chilling nightmare; in the following months, their jingoistic excitement would be replaced by desperate cries for help that would fall silent in the deadly snow-covered mountains of the Sierra Nevada. We know these early pioneers as the Donner Party, a name that has elicited horror since the late 1840s. Now, historian Michael Wallis continues his life's work of parsing fact from fiction to tell the true story of one of the most embroidered sagas in Western history. Wallis begins the story in 1846, a momentous "year of decision" for the nation, when incredible territorial strides were being made in Texas, New Mexico, and California. Against this dramatic backdrop, an unlikely band of travelers appeared, stratified in age, wealth, education and ethnicity. At the forefront were the Donners: brothers George and Jacob, true sons of the soil determined to tame the wild land of California; and the Reeds, headed by adventurous, business-savvy patriarch James. In total, the Donner-Reed group would reach eighty-seven men, women, and children, and though personal motives varied--bachelors thirsting for adventure, parents wanting greater futures for their children--everyone was linked by the same unwavering belief that California was theirs for the taking. Skeptical of previous accounts of how the group ended up in peril, Wallis has spent years retracing its ill-fated journey, uncovering hundreds of new documents that illuminate how a combination of greed, backbiting, and recklessness led the group to become hopelessly snowbound at the infamous Donner Pass in present-day California. Climaxing with the grim stories of how the party&#x2019; s paltry rations soon gave way to unimaginable hunger, Wallis not only details the cannibalism that has in perpetuity haunted their legacy but also the heroic rescue parties that managed to reach the stranded, only to discover that just forty-eight had survived the ordeal. An unflinching and historically invaluable account of the darkest side of Manifest Destiny, The Best Land Under Heaven offers a brilliant, revisionist examination of one of America's most calamitous and sensationalized catastrophes." -- Publisher's description 0aDonner Party. 0aPioneerszCaliforniaxHistoryy19th century. 0aPioneerszWest (U.S.)xHistoryy19th century. 0aOverland journeys to the Pacific. 0aFrontier and pioneer lifezWest (U.S.) 0aSierra Nevada (Calif. and Nev.)xHistoryy19th century. 1aDonner Party. 4aHISTORYxExpeditions & Discoveries. 4aHISTORYzUnited Statesx19th Century. 4aDonner Party.0(OCoLC)fst00896860 4aFrontier and pioneer life.0(OCoLC)fst00935370 4aOverland journeys to the Pacific.0(OCoLC)fst01049347 4aPioneers.0(OCoLC)fst01064447 7aCalifornia.2fast 7aUnited StateszSierra Nevada.2fast 7aUnited States, West.2fast 4aPioneerszCaliforniaxHistoryy19th century. 4aPioneerszWest (U.S)xHistoryy19th century. 4aFrontier and pioneer lifezWest (U.S.) 4aSierra Nevada (Calif. and Nev)xHistoryy19th century. 7a1800-18992fast 7aHistory.2fast  aF868 .N5 W36 2017hHIL-READiS03360086QkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180112b27.95e22.92f393960g1  a99974669627  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE02594cam  2200709 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077019002500094020002600119020001500145020001800160020001500178020001500193020001500208020001800223020001800241035002300259040016100282042001400443050002500457082001600482084004500498100003300543245004100576250002400617264003400641300002400675336002600699337002800725338002700753490004800780500003500828520022500863650001901088650001801107650002301125650002401148650002301172650002401195650005001219650006201269650003801331650003001369650003501399650003401434650002301468650001901491650002301510655002101533655001901554655002701573655002201600655002801622655002801650800006701678949006401745980003601809983001601845985002301861ocn981557754OCoLC20171208200022.4170203s2017    nyu           000 1 eng d  a  2017932991  a958780225a983201635  a9780316472203q(hbk.)  a0316472204  a9780316300339  a0316300330  a0356503542  a0316508187  a9780316508186  a9780356503547  a(Sirsi) o981557754  aTXNbengerdacDLCdIEBdJNEdPCXdLEBdCHYdIUKdYDXdHQDdBTCTAdNZDdSBRWNdZHBdJOVdATPTTdOCLCFdIGAdWVUdAUPTLdWTUdBYVdCHILDdAZZPTdOCLCOdOCLCQ  alccopycat00aPR6103.A72bB69 201704a823/.92223  aFIC028070aFIC002000aFIC0550002bisacsh1 aCarey, Mike,d1959-eauthor.14aThe boy on the bridge /cM.R.

They have shared everything, including their desire to escape the stifling limitations of their birthplace, the quiet town of Royston, Massachusetts. But as the two girls enter adolescence, their paths diverge and Cassie sets out on a journey that will put her life in danger and shatter her oldest friendship. The Burning Girl is a complex examination of the stories we tell ourselves about youth and friendship, and straddles, expertly, childhood's imaginary worlds and painful adult reality - crafting a true, immediate portrait of female adolescence. Claire Messud, one of the finest novelists, is as accomplished at weaving a compelling fictional world as she is at asking the big questions: To what extent can we know ourselves and others? What are the stories we create to comprehend our lives and relationships? Brilliantly mixing fable and coming-of-age tale, The Burning Girl gets to the heart of these matters in an absolutely irresistible way. -- from back cover. 0aFemale friendshipvFiction. 0aAdolescencevFiction. 0aMassachusettsvFiction. 1aComing of agevFiction. 4aFICTIONxLiterary. 4aAdolescence.0(OCoLC)fst00796984 4aFemale friendship.0(OCoLC)fst00922609 7aMassachusetts.2fast 4aBildungsromans. 7aBildungsromans.2fast 7aFiction.2fast 7aBildungsromans.2gsafd 7aBildungsromans.2lcgft  aPS3563 .E8134 B87 2017hHIL-READiS03360168RkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180112b25.95e21.28f393960g1  a99974668598  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE03398cam  2200505 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077019002500094020002600119020002300145035002300168040009300191042000800284050002100292082001700313100003100330245004900361250001900410264007400429300004700503336002600550337002800576338002700604500007200631520118600703504005101889505051701940650001202457650002102469650002102490650002202511650002202533650004202555650002902597650004002626650003202666650004102698655001902739949005902758980003602817983001602853985002302869ocn933272463OCoLC20170408044952.6160511t20162016ncua     b    001 0 eng    a  2016018795  a932577807a962930458  a9781616203641q(hbk.)  a1616203641q(hbk.)  a(Sirsi) o933272463  aCoCr/DLCbengerdacDLCdBTCTAdYDXCPdBDXdOCLCFdEGMdOCOdLD4dMOFdBUDAPdIGAdOCLCQ  apcc00aSF263b.K46 201600a641.3/722221 aKhosrova, Elaine,eauthor.10aButter :ba rich history /cElaine Khosrova.  aFirst edition. 1aChapel Hill, North Carolina :bAlgonquin Books of Chapel Hill,c2016.  axviii, 344 pages :billustrations ;c21 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  a"Published simultaneously in Canada by Thomas Allen & Son Limited."  a"The delicious kitchen staple we so often take for granted is not merely a stick tucked into our refrigerator door. It's a culinary catalyst, an agent of change, a gastronomic rock star. From its accidental invention in a long-ago herder's pouch to its ubiquitous presence in the world's most fabulous cuisines, butter is boss. Now, it finally gets its due. Award-winning food writer and chef Elaine Khosrova serves up a story as rich, textured, and culturally relevant as butter itself. From the ancient butter bogs of Ireland to the sacred butter sculptures of Tibet, Butter is about so much more than food. Khosrova details its surprisingly vital role in history, politics, economics, nutrition, even spirituality and art. From its humble agrarian origins to its present-day artisanal glory, butter has a fascinating story to tell, and Khosrova is the perfect person to tell it.

Yet Prunus persica itself is surprisingly rare in Georgia, and it has never played a major part in the southern agricultural economy. Why, then, have southerners - and Georgians in particular - clung to the fruit? 'The Georgia Peach: Culture, Agriculture, and Environment in the American South' shows that the peach emerged as a viable commodity at a moment when the South was desperate for a reputation makeover. This agricultural success made the fruit an enduring cultural icon despite the increasing difficulties of growing it. A delectable contribution to the renaissance in food writing, The Georgia Peach will be of great interest to connoisseurs of food, southern, environmental, rural, and agricultural history.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 229-295) and index.0 aIntroduction : an invitation -- A wilderness of peach trees -- A baron of pears -- Elberta, you're a peach -- A Connecticut yankee in king cotton's court -- Rot and glut -- Blossoms and hams -- Under the trees -- Conclusion : a benediction. 0aPeachzSouthern States. 4aPeach.0(OCoLC)fst01055910 7aSouthern States.2fast 0aCambridge studies on the American South.  aSB371 .O45 2016hHIL-READiS03360162LkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180112b34.99e28.69f393960g1  a99974669715  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE03074cam  2200469 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077020003100094020002800125035002300153040012800176042000800304050002500312082001500337084003400352100003500386245004900421250001900470264004800489264001000537300002300547336002600570337002800596338002700624520144800651650005102099650004402150650002302194650003302217650005502250650006202305655002202367655002802389655001902417655002902436949006402465980003602529983001602565985002302581ocn958351458OCoLC20170824043824.8160923t20172017nyu           000 f eng    a  2016039559  a9781250109163q(hardcover)  a1250109167q(hardcover)  a(Sirsi) o958351458  aDLCbengerdacDLCdYDXdBTCTAdBDXdOCLCOdOCLCFdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCOdIK2dPOSTPdVP@dYDXdOCLCOdOCLCQdOCLCOdOCLdRB0  apcc00aPS3611.H66bG66 201700a813/.6223  aFIC019000aFIC0440002bisacsh1 aKhong, Rachel,d1985-eauthor.10aGoodbye, vitamin :ba novel /cRachel Khong.  aFirst edition. 1aNew York :bHenry Holt and Company,c[2017] 4c√2017  a196 pages ;c22 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  a""Incredibly poignant ... Rachel Khong's first novel sneaks up on you -- just like life ... and heartbreak. And love."--Miranda July A few days after Christmas in a small suburb outside of L.A., pairs of a man's pants hang from the trees. The pants belong to Howard Young, a prominent history professor, recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Howard's wife, Annie, summons their daughter, Ruth. Freshly disengaged from her fiance and still broken up about it, feeling that life has not turned out quite the way she planned, thirty-year- old Ruth quits her job, and arrives home to find her parents' situation worse than she'd realized. Her father is erratically lucid and her mother, a devoted and creative cook, sees the sources of memory loss in every pot and pan. But as Howard's condition intensifies, the comedy in Ruth's situation takes hold, gently transforming her grief. She throws herself into caretaking: cooking dementia-fighting meals (a feast of jellyfish!), researching supplements, anything to reignite her father's once-notable memory. And when the university finally lets Howard go, Ruth and one of her father's handsome former students take their efforts to help Howard one step too far.

She doesn't care what anyone thinks of her. She likes a beer and a shot and wouldn't be caught dead wearing anything fashionable. She's inherited her father's rundown house on Martha's Vineyard, but she can't hold down a job, and her latest romantic disaster has the entire island talking. Tabitha Frost is dignified, refined. She prefers a fine wine and has inherited the impeccable taste of her mother, the iconic fashion designer Eleanor Roxie-Frost. She's also inherited her mother's questionable parenting skills--Tabitha's teenage daughter, Ainsley, is in full rebellion mode--and a flailing fashion boutique on Nantucket in desperate need of a cash infusion. After more than a decade apart, Harper and Tabitha switch islands--and lives--to save what's left of their splintered family. But the twins quickly discover that the secrets, lies, and gossip they thought they'd outrun can travel between islands just as easily as they can. Will Harper and Tabitha be able to bury the hatchet and end their sibling rivalry once and for all? Before the last beach picnic of the season, there will be enough old resentments, new loves, and cases of mistaken identity to make this the most talked-about summer that Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket have experienced in ages."--cDust jacket. 0aTwin sistersvFiction. 0aSistersvFiction. 0aWomenxFamily relationshipsvFiction. 0aSibling rivalryvFiction. 0aFamily secretsvFiction. 0aAdulteryvFiction. 0aMothers and daughtersvFiction. 0aNantucket Island (Mass.)vFiction. 0aMartha's Vineyard (Mass.)vFiction. 1aTwinsvFiction. 1aSistersvFiction. 1aFamily lifevFiction. 4aFICTIONxContemporary Women. 4aFICTIONxFamily Life. 4aFICTIONxRomancexRomantic Comedy. 4aFICTIONxSea Stories. 4aWomenxFamily relationships.0(OCoLC)fst01176742 4aSisters.0(OCoLC)fst01119758 4aSibling rivalry.0(OCoLC)fst01118007 4aMothers and daughters.0(OCoLC)fst01026997 4aFamily secrets.0(OCoLC)fst01737651 4aAdultery.0(OCoLC)fst00797378 4aTwin sisters.0(OCoLC)fst01762227 7aMassachusettszMartha's Vineyard.2fast 7aMassachusettszNantucket Island.2fast 4aTwinsvFiction. 7aNantucket Island (Mass.)vFiction.2sears 7aMartha's Vineyard (Mass.)vFiction.2sears 4aNantucket Island (Mass.)vFiction. 2aMartha's Vineyard (Mass.)vFiction. 7aDomestic fiction.2fast 7aFiction.2fast 7aDomestic fiction.2lcgft 7aFiction.2lcgft 4aDomestic fiction.  aPS3558 .I384355 I34 2017hHIL-READiS03360159RkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180112b28.00e22.96f393960g1  a99974668774  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE04825cam  2200637 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077019002500094020001800119020001500137024001600152035002300168037009400191040012800285042000800413043001200421050002300433082002000456100003300476245012300509246007200632250001900704264004000723300007300763336002100836337002500857338002300882504006700905505056500972520151901537610007203056610008903128610006303217650003803280650007203318650003803390650004703428651003803475650007703513650004403590650004303634650004303677650004303720651002503763650004003788650002303828650004303851655001903894776013703913949006204050980003604112983001604148985002304164ocn946610757OCoLC20171103032530.2160411s2017    nyua     b    001 0 eng    a  2016017245  a967558617a980906973  a9780385351799  a03853517988 a40027283297  a(Sirsi) o946610757  bRandom House Inc, Attn Order Entry 400 Hahn rd, Westminster, MD, USA, 21157nSAN 201-3975  aDLCbengerdacDLCdOCLCFdYDXCPdBTCTAdBDXdVTLdBKLdIGAdYDXdNLGGCdBURdIDUdNDSdOCPdWVUdYUSdTULdOCLCOdITDdCOH  apcc  an-us---00aU394.A75bW45 201700a355/.0409732231 aWeinberger, Sharon,eauthor.14aThe imagineers of war :bthe untold history of DARPA, the Pentagon agency that changed the world /cSharon Weinberger.30aUntold history of DARPA, the Pentagon agency that changed the world  aFirst edition. 1aNew York :bAlfred A.

Founded in 1958 in response to the launch of Sputnik, the agency's original mission was to create "the unimagined weapons of the future." Over the decades, DARPA has been responsible for countless inventions and technologies that extend well beyond the military. Sharon Weinberger gives us a riveting account of DARPA's successes and failures, its remarkable innovations, and its wild-eyed schemes. We see how the threat of nuclear Armageddon sparked investment in computer networking, leading to the Internet, as well as to a proposal to power a missile-destroying particle beam by draining the Great Lakes. We learn how DARPA was responsible during the Vietnam War for both Agent Orange and the development of the world's first armed drones, and how after 9/11 the agency sparked a national controversy over surveillance with its data-mining research. And we see how DARPA's success with self-driving cars was followed by disappointing contributions to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. Weinberger has interviewed more than one hundred former Pentagon officials and scientists involved in DARPA's projects -- many of whom have never spoken publicly about their work with the agency -- and pored over countless declassified records from archives around the country, documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, and exclusive materials provided by sources.10aUnited States.bDefense Advanced Research Projects AgencyxHistory.17aUnited States.bDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency.2fast0(OCoLC)fst0052931824aUnited States.bDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency. 0aMilitary researchzUnited States. 0aMilitary art and sciencexTechnological innovationszUnited States. 0aScience and statezUnited States. 0aNational securityzUnited StatesxHistory. 0aUnited StatesxDefensesxHistory. 4aMilitary art and sciencexTechnological innovations.0(OCoLC)fst01020921 4aMilitary readiness.0(OCoLC)fst01021419 4aMilitary research.0(OCoLC)fst01021439 4aNational security.0(OCoLC)fst01033711 4aScience and state.0(OCoLC)fst01108536 7aUnited States.2fast 4aHISTORY / Military / United States. 4aSCIENCE / History. 4aTECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING / Inventions. 7aHistory.2fast08iOnline version:aWeinberger, Sharon, author.tImagineers of wardNew York : Alfred A.

In 1913, the restless world sat on the brink of unimaginable suffering. But for one woman, the darkness of a new era had already made itself at home. Isadora Duncan would come to be known as the mother of modern dance, but in the spring of 1913 she was a grieving mother, after a freak accident in Paris resulted in the drowning death of her two young children. The accident cracked Isadora's life in two: on one side, the brilliant young talent who captivated audiences the world over; on the other, a heartbroken mother spinning dangerously on the edge of sanity."--cfrom Amazon.com.10aDuncan, Isadora,d1877-1927vFiction.14aDuncan, Isadora,d1877-1927. 0aWomen dancersvFiction. 4aWomen dancers.0(OCoLC)fst01177550 4aFICTION / Biographical. 4aFICTION / Historical. 4aFICTION / Literary. 7aBiographical fiction.2fast 7aFiction.2fast 7aBiographical fiction.2lcgft 7aBiographical fiction.2gsafd  aPS3607 .R387 I82 2017hHIL-READiS03360164NkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180112b27.00e22.14f393960g1  a99974668793  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE04523cam  2200541 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077019010300094020002900197020002600226035002300252040012100275042000800396043001200404050002500416082002400441100003200465245004400497250001900541264005000560264001000610300009000620336002600710337002800736338002700764520187100791504005102662505069002713600001503403600001503418650004603433650004003479651002503519650005503544650006503599650004703664650004603711655002303757655002103780655002403801655001703825949006403842980003603906983001603942985002303958ocn973118697OCoLC20171107041206.4170227t20172017nyuaf    b    001 0beng    a  2017008817  a972386523a972564819a972606542a972799386a972826308a972946538a972975880a973144963a1003797953  a9780316376556qhardcover  a0316376558qhardcover  a(Sirsi) o973118697  aDLCbengerdacDLCdYDXdBTCTAdBDXdOCLCOdOCLCFdGK8dOCLdJAIdUOKdOQXdBURdIUKdYDXdCLEdIGAdVP@dPFLCLdJQM  apcc  an-us---00aML420.R299bD43 201700a782.42166092aB2231 aDeCurtis, Anthony,eauthor.10aLou Reed :ba life /cAnthony DeCurtis.  aFirst edition. 1aNew York :bLittle, Brown and Company,c2017. 4c√2017  aviii, 519 pages, 16 unnumbered pages of plates :billustrations (some color) ;c25 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  a"The essential biography of one of music's most influential icons: Lou Reed. As lead singer and songwriter for the Velvet Underground and a renowned solo artist, Lou Reed invented alternative rock. His music, at once a source of transcendent beauty and coruscating noise, violated all definitions of genre while speaking to millions of fans and inspiring generations of musicians. But while his iconic status may be fixed, the man himself was anything but. Lou Reed's life was a transformer's odyssey. Eternally restless and endlessly hungry for new experiences, Reed reinvented his persona, his sound, even his sexuality time and again. A man of contradictions and extremes, he was fiercely independent yet afraid of being alone, artistically fearless yet deeply paranoid, eager for commercial success yet disdainful of his own triumphs. Channeling his jagged energy and literary sensibility into classic songs--like "Walk on the Wild Side" and "Sweet Jane"--and radically experimental albums alike, Reed remained desperately true to his artistic vision, wherever it led him. Now, just a few years after Reed's death, Rolling Stone writer Anthony DeCurtis, who knew Reed and interviewed him extensively, tells the provocative story of his complex and chameleonic life. With unparalleled access to dozens of Reed's friends, family, and collaborators, DeCurtis tracks Reed's five-decade career through the accounts of those who knew him and through Reed's most revealing testimony, his music. We travel deep into his defiantly subterranean world, enter the studio as the Velvet Underground record their groundbreaking work, and revel in Reed's relationships with such legendary figures as Andy Warhol, David Bowie, and Laurie Anderson. Gritty, intimate, and unflinching, Lou Reed is an illuminating tribute to one of the most incendiary artists of our time."--Jacket.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aIntroduction: Anything for you -- From Brooklyn to the crotch of Long Island -- Corner table at the Orange -- Fellini squared -- The destructive element -- Aggressive, going to God -- All the things that are missing -- Transformer -- A city's divided soul -- Rock n roll animal -- One machine talking to another -- A speed-addled, leather-clad Virgil -- This gender business -- Fucking faggot junkie -- Growing up in public -- Just an average guy -- New sensations -- New York -- I hate Lou Reed -- Magic and loss -- Between thought and expression -- Me burger with I sauce -- Fourteenth chance -- Sadly listening -- This is today -- Metallica -- The measure of a man -- The afterlife.10aReed, Lou.14aReed, Lou. 0aRock musicianszUnited StatesvBiography. 4aRock musicians.0(OCoLC)fst01099238 7aUnited States.2fast 4aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Composers & Musicians. 4aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Entertainment & Performing Arts. 4aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Rich & Famous. 4aRock musicianszUnited StatesvBiography. 7aBiographies.2fast 7aBiography.2fast 7aBiographies.2lcgft 4aBiographies.  aML420 .R299 D43 2017hHIL-READiS03360163MkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180112b32.00e26.24f393960g1  a99974669146  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE03082cam  2200625 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077019001400094020003000108020002700138020003100165020002800196020002700224024001600251035002300267040016400290042000800454043001200462050002600474082001700500084002300517100003900540245004000579250002400619264007100643264001000714300003100724336002600755337002800781338002700809500008600836520017300922520064701095650002101742650002801763650002701791651003101818650002301849650003801872650003901910650003201949651002701981655003502008655004102043655001902084655002802103655004202131776014302173949006502316980003602381983001602417985002302433ocn959036988OCoLC20171003062000.6161114t20172017nyu           000 1 eng    a  2016045021  a988972135  a9780062645227q(hardback)  a0062645226q(hardback)  a9780062645234q(paperback)  a0062645234q(paperback)  z9780062645241q(ebook)8 a40027283272  a(Sirsi) o959036988  aDLCbengerdacDLCdYDXdBDXdOCLCQdDADdOCLCOdVTLdIK2dLEBdABGdIHVdJNEdMIBLSdZHBdJSEdILCdJQMdOCLCOdOCLCFdTXAdOCLdYUSdYXVdOCLCAdTXSCHdOCLCQ  apcc  ae-uk-en00aPR6058.O715bM34 201700a823/.914223  aFIC0190002bisacsh1 aHorowitz, Anthony,d1955-eauthor.10aMagpie murders /cAnthony Horowitz.  aFirst U.S. edition. 1aNew York :bHarper, an imprint of HarperCollinsPublishers,c[2017] 4c√2017  a4, 213, 236 pages ;c24 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  a"Originally published in Great Britain in 2016 by Orion Books"--Title page verso.  aA "brilliant and strikingly original reimagining of the classic whodunit (a la Agatha Christie) with a contemporary mystery wrapped around it"--cProvided by publisher.  aAfter working with bestselling crime writer Alan Conway for years, editor Susan Ryeland is intimately familiar with his detective, Atticus PËund, who solves mysteries in sleepy English villages.

When her father is killed and her family is forced into Camp Patience for displaced persons, she begins to grow up shaped by her particular time and place. But not everyone at Camp Patience is who they claim to be. Eventually Sarat is befriended by a mysterious functionary, under whose influence she is turned into a deadly instrument of war.

The book is an urgent call for a return to bedrock conservative principle and a cry to once again put country before party. "I am a conservative. I believe that there are limits to what government can and should do, that there are some problems that government cannot solve, and that human initiative is best when left unfettered, free from government interference or coercion. I believe that these ideas, tested by time, offer the most freedom and best outcomes in the lives of the most people. But today, the American conservative movement has lost its way. Given the state of our politics, it is no exaggeration to say that this is an urgent matter. The Republican party used to play to a broader audience, one that demanded that we accomplish something. But in this era of dysfunction, our pri mary accomplishment has been constructing the argument that we're not to blame. We have decided that it is better to build and maintain a majority by using the levers of power rather than the art of persuasion and the battle of ideas. We've decided that putting party over country is okay. There are many on both sides of the aisle who think this a good model on which to build a political career--destroying, not building. And all the while, our country burns, our institutions are undermined, and our values are compromised. We have become so estranged from our principles that we no longer know what principle is. America is not just a collection of transactions. America is also a collection of ideas and values. And these are our values. These are our principles. They are not subject to change, owing to political fashion or cult of personality. I believe that we desperately need to get back to the rigorous, fact-based arguments that made us conservatives in the first place. We need to realize that the stakes are simply too high to remain silent and fall in line. That is why I have written this book and am taking this stand."--Jacket.0 aPreface: To stand alone -- The crisis we face -- On bad information and the threat to democracy -- Conscience of a conservative -- On free trade, not-so-free trade, populism, nationalism, and the collapse of what we believe in -- How did this happen?

When Liv and Nora decide to take their families on a holiday cruise, everyone is thrilled. The ship's comforts and possibilities seem infinite. The children--two eleven-year-olds, an eight-year-old, and a six-year-old--love the nonstop buffet and the independence they have at the Kids' Club. But when they all go ashore in beautiful Central America, a series of minor misfortunes leads the families farther and farther from the ship's safety. One minute the children are there, and the next they're gone. What follows is a riveting, revealing story told from the perspectives of the adults and the children, as the once-happy parents--now turning on one another and blaming themselves--try to recover their children and their lives. Celebrated for her ability to write vivid, spare, moving fiction, Maile Meloy shows how quickly the life we count on can fall away, and how a crisis changes everyone's priorities. The fast-paced, gripping plot of Do Not Become Alarmed carries with it an insightful, provocative examination of privilege, race, guilt, envy, the dilemmas of modern parenthood, and the challenge of living up to our own expectations"--cProvided by publisher.  a"From a beloved, award-winning writer, the much-anticipated novel about what happens when two families go on a tropical vacation--and

has worked for, while nonprofit employee Julia reconnects with someone from her past who represents a different kind of life.  aFor Evan, a scholarship student from a rural Canadian town, Yale is a whole new world, and Julia-- blond, beautiful, and rich-- fits perfectly into the future he's envisioned.

In Good Booty, Ann Powers explores how popular music became America's primary erotic art form. She takes us from nineteenth-century New Orleans through dance-crazed Jazz Age New York to the teen scream years of mid-twentieth-century rock and roll and the cutting-edge adventures of today's viral pop stars. Drawing on her deep knowledge of gender and sexuality, Powers recounts stories of forbidden lovers, wild shimmy-shakers, orgasmic gospel singers, countercultural perverts, soft-rock sensitivos, punk Puritans, and the cyborg known as Britney Spears to illuminate how eroticism--not merely sex, but love, bodily freedom, and liberating joy--became entwined within the rhythms and melodies of American song. This cohesion, she reveals, touches the heart of America's anxieties and hopes about race, feminism, marriage, youth, and freedom. Spanning more than a century of music, Powers both heralds little-known artists--such as Florence Mills, a contemporary of Josephine Baker, and gospel queen Dorothy Love Coates--and sheds new light on artists we think we know well, from the Beatles and Jim Morrison to Madonna and Beyonc‚e. In telling the history of how American popular music and sexuality intersect, Good Booty--Powers's magnum opus over two decades in the making--offers new insights into our national psyche and our soul."--Jacket.0 aThe taboo baby: New Orleans, 1800-1900 -- That da da strain: shimmying, shaking, sexology: New York, 1900-1929 -- Let it breathe on me: spiritual erotics: Chicago, Birmingham, Memphis, 1929-1956 -- Teen dreams and grown-up urges: the American heartland, 1950-1960 -- The sexual revolution and its discontents: New York, Detroit, San Francisco, Los Angeles, 1961-1970 -- Hard and soft realities: London, Los Angeles, New York, 1971-1979 -- Oh no, it hurts: AIDS, Reagan, and the backlash: New York, San Francisco, Seattle, 1977-1997 -- Hungry cyborgs: Britney, Beyonc‚e, and the virtual frontier: Cyberspace, 1999-2016. 0aGender identity in music. 0aMusic and racezUnited States. 0aSex in music. 0aSex role in music. 0aPopular musiczUnited StatesxHistory and criticism. 0aMusicxSocial aspectszUnited StatesxHistory and criticism. 4aHISTORYzUnited Statesx20th Century. 4aMUSICxHistory & Criticism. 4aSOCIAL SCIENCExPopular Culture. 4aMusicxSocial aspects.0(OCoLC)fst01030444 4aPopular music.0(OCoLC)fst01071422 7aUnited States.2fast 4aMUSIC / History & Criticism. 4aSOCIAL SCIENCE / Popular Culture. 4aHISTORY / Social History. 7aCriticism, interpretation, etc.2fast  aML3477 .P69 2017hHIL-READiS03360170KkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180112b26.99e22.13f393965g1  a99974668805  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE02172cam  2200505 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077020003000094020002700124035002300151040011700174042001400291050002800305082001600333100002800349245007200377264003900449300003800488336002600526337002800552338002700580490003000607490003600637520038700673650004101060650004101101650003801142650003001180650005201210650002101262655002801283655002701311655002701338655001901365655002801384655002801412800004701440830003701487949006701524980003601591983001601627985002301643ocn946693373OCoLC20170412043449.6170308s2017    nyub          000 1 eng d  a  2017288168  a9780756412487 (hardcover)  a075641248X (hardcover)  a(Sirsi) o946693373  aYDXCPbengerdacYDXCPdDLCdBTCTAdBDXdGMPdTOHdAW3dGO6dTXNdAZTdVP@dIGAdPFLCLdOCLCFdINRdTXNPSdTXMAL  alccopycat00aPS3573.I45563bH43 201700a813/.542231 aWilliams, Tad,eauthor.14aThe heart of what was lost :ba novel of Osten Ard /cTad Williams. 1aNew York, NY :bDAW Books,c[2017]  aviii, 210 pages :bmaps ;c24 cm.  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier1 aMemory, sorrow, and thorn1 aDAW book collectors ;vno. 1744  a"Takes place in the half-year after the end of To Green Angel Tower, and tells of the attempt by Isgrimnur and a force largely made up of Rimmersgard soldiers to destroy the remaining Norns as they flee back to their homeland and their mountain.

Garlanded with critical acclaim, it was named a book of the year byThe Washington Postand theSan Francisco Chronicle, nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award, short-listed for the Man Booker Prize, and won the PEN/Hemingway Award for debut fiction. But as many critics noted, Moshfegh is particularly held in awe for her short stories. Homesick for Another World is the rare case where an author's short story collection is if anything more anticipated than her novel. And for good reason. There's something eerily unsettling about Ottessa Moshfegh's stories, something almost dangerous, while also being delightful, and even laugh-out-loud funny. Her characters are all unsteady on their feet in one way or another; they all yearn for connection and betterment, though each in very different ways, but they are often tripped up by their own baser impulses and existential insecurities. Homesick for Another Worldis a master class in the varieties of self-deception across the gamut of individuals representing the human condition. But part of the unique quality of her voice, the echt Moshfeghian experience, is the way the grotesque and the outrageous are infused with tenderness and compassion. Moshfegh is our Flannery O'Connor, and Homesick for Another Worldis her Everything That Rises Must Convergeor A Good Man is Hard to Find. The flesh is weak; the timber is crooked; people are cruel to each other, and stupid, and hurtful. But beauty comes from strange sources. And the dark energy surging through these stories is powerfully invigorating. We're in the hands of an author with a big mind, a big heart, blazing chops, and a political acuity that is needle-sharp.

A man of contradictions, he preached that the Brethren should shun the outside world, which was ruled by Satan, yet he kept a radio in the trunk of his car and read Shakespeare and Yeats. Years later, when the Stotts broke with the Brethren after a scandal involving the cult's leader, Roger became an actor and compulsive gambler who left the family penniless and ended up in jail ... In the Days of Rain is Rebecca Stott's attempt to make sense of her childhood in the Exclusive Brethren, to understand her father's role in the cult and in the breaking apart of her family, and to come to be at peace with her relationship with a larger-than-life figure whose faults were matched by a passion for life, a thirst for knowledge, and a love of literature and beauty. A father-daughter story as well as a memoir of growing up in a closed-off community and then finding a way out of it, this is an inspiring and beautiful account of the bonds of family and the power of self-invention."--Jacket.10aStott, Roger M.,d1938-2007. 0aPlymouth BrethrenzEnglandvBiography. 0aPlymouth BrethrenzEnglandxHistory. 4aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHYxPersonal Memoirs. 4aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHYxReligious. 4aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHYxWomen. 7aBiographies.2lcgft  aBX8809 .S76 S76 2017hHIL-READiS03360169SkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180112b27.00e22.14f393965g1  a99974668784  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE03382cam  2200709 i 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036010001700077019005900094020003100153020002800184024001600212035002300228037009400251040019000345042000800535043001200543050002800555082001700583084004500600100002800645245005800673250001900731264003800750300002300788336002600811337002800837338002700865504005700892520083800949600002801787600001901815650004401834651004001878651004701918651004001965650002702005650002502032650002302057650003402080651003202114651001702146651002302163650002402186650002202210650002602232648002002258655002402278655003202302655001902334655003002353655001902383655003302402655003102435655003302466655003102499949006702530980003602597983001602633985002302649ocn952943018OCoLC20170919093036.3160701s2017    nyu      b    000 1 eng    a  2016025060  a973479118a975817385a975892642a982718972a1002172732  a9780812996975q(hardcover)  a0812996976q(hardcover)8 a40026952394  a(Sirsi) o952943018  bRandom House Inc, Attn Order Entry 400 Hahn rd, Westminster, MD, USA, 21157nSAN 201-3975  aDLCbengerdacDLCdOCLCOdBDXdYDXCPdBTCTAdORXdJSEdOCJdOCLCOdIUKdZHBdOCLCQdPRSPRdYDXdOCLCOdVLRdKYCdCHYdIGAdOCLCFdT7RdYUSdDUDdPAZdCD5dJTQdALPELdOCLCQdBYVdCHILD  apcc  ae-it---00aPR6054.U45756bI53 201700a823/.914223  aFIC014000aFIC019000aFIC0410002bisacsh1 aDunant, Sarah,eauthor.10aIn the name of the family :ba novel /cSarah Dunant.  aFirst edition. 1aNew York :bRandom House,c[2017]  a429 pages ;c25 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 427-429).  a"It is 1502 and Rodrigo Borgia, a self-confessed womanizer and master of political corruption, is now on the papal throne as Alexander VI. His daughter Lucrezia, aged twenty-two--already three times married and a pawn in her father's plans--is discovering her own power. And then there is his son Cesare Borgia, brilliant, ruthless, and increasingly unstable; it is his relationship with Machiavelli that gives the Florentine diplomat a master class in the dark arts of power and politics. What Machiavelli learns will go on to inform his great work of modern politics, The Prince. But while the pope rails against old age and his son's increasingly erratic behavior, it is Lucrezia who must navigate the treacherous court of Urbino, her new home, and another challenging marriage to create her own place in history."--cbook jacket.30aBorgia familyvFiction.34aBorgia family. 0aNobilityzItalyzPapal StatesvFiction. 0aItalyxHistoryy1492-1559vFiction. 0aRome (Italy)xHistoryy1420-1798vFiction. 1aItalyxHistoryy1492-1559vFiction. 4aFICTIONxBiographical. 4aFICTIONxHistorical. 4aFICTIONxLiterary. 4aNobility.0(OCoLC)fst01038255 7aEuropezPapal States.2fast 7aItaly.2fast 7aItalyzRome.2fast 4aHistorical fiction. 4aLiterary fiction. 4aBiographical fiction. 7a1420-17982fast 4aHistorical fiction. 7aBiographical fiction.2fast 7aFiction.2fast 7aHistorical fiction.2fast 7aHistory.2fast 7aBiographical fiction.2gsafd 7aHistorical fiction.2gsafd 7aBiographical fiction.2lcgft 7aHistorical fiction.2lcgft  aPR6054 .U45756 I53 2017hHIL-READiS03360156OkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180112b28.00e22.96f393965g1  a99974668786  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE05438cam  2200853Ii 4500001001300000003000600013005001700019008004100036020002800077020003100105020002700136035002300163037011900186040017100305043001200476050002300488060002300511082001600534082001900550084002300569100004800592245006200640264003500702264001000737300004000747336002600787336003300813337002800846338002700874505074000901520024601641520123301887600002403120600003403144600004503178600003103223600002403254600003103278600002403309600003103333651006003364651005703424650005203481650002403533650005803557650005403615650005703669650005203726650004903778650003303827650003503860650003303895650004903928650004503977650003804022650003904060650004404099651003804143650005204181650002504233651001904258648002004277655002704297655002104324655001904345655002104364655002804385655002004413655001504433949006104448980003604509983001604545985002304561ocn971246712OCoLC20171204155716.6160429t20172017nyua          000 0ceng d  a1620404931q(hardcover)  a9781620404935q(hardcover)  z9781620404959q(ebook)  a(Sirsi) o971246712  bSt Martins Pr, C/O Mps 16365 James Madison Hwy Us Hwy 15, Gordonsville, VA, USA, 22942, (212)6745151nSAN 631-5011  aCGPbengerdacCGPdOCLCOdGP5dON8dFM0dPFLCLdIGAdVP@dMR0dYDXdOCLCFdOCLCQdOCLCOdGK8dOCLdAUPTLdBURdEUWdCOUdOCLCOdSFRdBYVdOCLCQdXFHdICZdOCLCOdUAB  an-us-ny 4aCT220.5b.H39 2017 4aCT 220.5bH39 201704a813/.5422304a920.073aB223  aBIO0260002bisacsh1 aHayes, Bill,d1961-eauthor,ephotographer.10aInsomniac City :bNew York, Oliver, and me /cBill Hayes. 1aNew York :bBloomsbury,c2017. 4c√2017  a291 pages :billustrations ;c22 cm  atextbtxt2rdacontent  astill imagebsti2rdacontent  aunmediatedbn2rdamedia  avolumebnc2rdacarrier0 apt.

But at forty-eight years old, having spent decades in San Francisco, he craved change. Grieving over the death of his partner, he quickly discovered the profound consolations of the city's incessant rhythms, the sight of the Empire State Building against the night sky, and New Yorkers themselves, kindred souls that Hayes, a lifelong insomniac, encountered on late-night strolls with his camera. And he unexpectedly fell in love again, with his friend and neighbor, the writer and neurologist Oliver Sacks, whose exuberance--"I don't so much fear death as I do wasting life, " he tells Hayes early on--is captured in funny and touching vignettes throughout. What emerges is a portrait of Sacks at his most personal and endearing, from falling in love for the first time at age seventy-five to facing illness and death (Sacks died of cancer in August 2015). Insomniac City is both a meditation on grief and a celebration of life. Filled with Hayes's distinctive street photos of everyday New Yorkers, the book is a love song to the city and to all who have felt the particular magic and solace it offers."--Jacket.10aHayes, Bill,d1961-10aHayes, Bill,d1961-vDiaries.10aHayes, Bill,d1961-xRelations with men.10aSacks, Oliver,d1933-2015.14aHayes, Bill,d1961-14aSacks, Oliver,d1933-2015.12aHayes, Bill,d1961-12aSacks, Oliver,d1933-2015. 0aNew York (N.Y.)xSocial life and customsy21st century. 0aNew York (N.Y.)xSocial life and customsvPortraits. 0aGay menzNew York (State)zNew YorkvBiography. 0aAuthorsvBiography. 0aPhotographerszNew York (State)zNew YorkvBiography. 0aEssayistszNew York (State)zNew YorkvBiography. 0aNeurologistszNew York (State)zNew YorkvBiography. 0aStreet photographyzNew York (State)zNew York. 4aBIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHYxPersonal Memoirs. 4aAuthors.0(OCoLC)fst00821688 4aEssayists.0(OCoLC)fst00915436 4aGay men.0(OCoLC)fst00939117 4aMan-woman relationships.0(OCoLC)fst01007080 4aManners and customs.0(OCoLC)fst01007815 4aNeurologists.0(OCoLC)fst01036386 4aPhotographers.0(OCoLC)fst01061605 4aStreet photography.0(OCoLC)fst01134710 7aNew York (State)zNew York.2fast 4aGay menzNew York (State)zNew YorkvBiography.22aHomosexuality, Male. 2aNew York City. 7a2000-20992fast 7aAutobiographies.2fast 7aBiography.2fast 7aDiaries.2fast 7aPortraits.2fast 7aAutobiographies.2lcgft 7aDiaries.2lcgft 2aBiography.  aCT220.5 .H39 2017hHIL-READiS03360151JkONORDER0YBPCAT  a180112b27.00e22.14f393965g1  a99974668791  aHSFIR-READeYANKEE
